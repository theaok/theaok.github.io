This is the bottom line: 
Brown bags don't work! It's like final paper showoff; this one is for bouncing ideas:
Weekly one hour, presentation is about 15min but no more that low 20ish, like 2/3 of discussion

Brief writep as to introduce to Lori and ask for comments, same with Paul Michael and Steve and ask for comments. Especially when?
Say Thursday at 4? ( So it is before the class)

Weekly one hour, presentation is about 15min but no more that low 20ish, like 2/3 of discussion

and any other faculty and students welcomed to attend as well, say especially psychology, sociology, and childhood studies.
