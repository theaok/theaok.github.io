<font color="blue"> General points so far: trying to be as
  interdisciplinary and inclusive as possible (maybe complicating this
  too much!) and so far had actually unexpectedly great
  discussions with people from across FASC, pretty much everyone excited AND also willing to compromise. However, looks like there are 2 camps: STEM v soc sci/humanities, and so maybe lets have 2 tracks. This is what i think Ray was also kind of suggesting. This would allow flexibility and having everyone on board and this could actually be our comparative advantage over competition that we have trully interdisciplinary program. Also, it is easy: most classes already exist, just have to develop 3-4 new classes for the core: I have one almost already ready (data management/Pandas and visualization/Matplotlib) and other ones i can easily develop possibly ideally as co-taught classes, there was enthusiasm on co-teaching: Haydee, I-Ming).

Welcome to 12 credit certificate / 30 credit MS in data science!<br><br>

All core classes are taught in Python, with possible small additions of other software. Electives vary.

<dl>Everyone needs to complete short common core, and then pick 
electives possibly mostly either from one of (though can combine):
  <li> STEM data science: computer science/math/engineering/science
    (lead: haydee, sunil) 
  <li> CSS data science: Computational Social Science (and Humanities) (lead: adam, dan)
</dl>


<h3>core classes (Python) 12 credits (4classes*3credits) [certificate:
  2 or 3 of these + 1 or 2 electives; <font color="blue">yes, we need to redo  our certificate!!</font>]</h3>

<font color="blue">everybody needs to take intro and data
  management/Pandas and visualization/Matplotlib; but  the other 2 core classes: possibly 2 tracks:
  for STEM: CS/math classes  that i am narrowing down (see below); and
  for soc sci/humanities: some lighter more applied equivalents: i am
  actually happy to develop these from scratch (maybe co-teach with
  dan, paul, sarah, i-ming, jim?) </font>

<dl> 
  <li> intro: theory, Py basics and math basics (distributions,
    probability, etc): co-taught adam, haydee?, sunil?
    <ul>STEM track
      <li> data structures/databases/big data/alghoritms: haydee+sunil?
      <li> one more that's similar: either iming's et al machine
      learning or similar from CS or alghoritms/stats using R from
      math dept by Debashis Kushary or 56:645:549-550 Linear Algebra and Applications
    </ul>
    <ul>soc sci/humanities track
      <li> lighter/applied equivalents of the above STEM 2 classes
    </ul>
  <li> data management/Pandas and visualization/Matplotlib: adam
</dl>

<h3>do i need math?</h3>

Yes, you need some, and ideally the more the better--math makes your transcript and CV look good--shows you can think logically with numbers--yet much math is not necessary, if you don't think better with math or have a "math block" you'll only have to take most basic math. And surely there is some "math fetish"--pushing use of math for the sake of it because it looks good. And surely math does disservice to many people and creates anxiety as opposed to learning. Yet, also for many math does help and initial math block is often illusory--a person is afraid until she tries it and it works. 

Hence, only basic math is required, but there's plenty of math offered
as electives.
