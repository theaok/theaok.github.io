<h2>pondering ideas, thinking, logic </h2>

<h3>General points/philosophy</h3>

  Interdisciplinary and inclusive as possible (maybe complicating this
  too much!) and so far had actually unexpectedly great
  discussions with people from across FASC, pretty much everyone
  excited AND also willing to compromise.  
<br>

Note that Python over R is a choice (just for core,
  not electives), but i have a
  ton of recent evidence that Python is better, just one here, scroll
  to table mid page https://mbs.rutgers.edu/program/analytics-discovery-informatics-data-sciences 

<h3>STEM v CSS</h3>

However, looks like there
  are 2 camps: STEM v soc sci/humanities, and so maybe lets have 2
  tracks. This is what i think Ray was also kind of suggesting. And
  this is what others do, eg NB has 3 tracks:
  https://mbs.rutgers.edu/program/analytics-discovery-informatics-data-sciences
  but we allow more flexibility with courses.
This would allow flexibility and having everyone on board and this could actually be our comparative advantage over competition that we have trully interdisciplinary program. Also, it is easy: most classes already exist, just have to develop 3-4 new classes for the core: I have one almost already ready (data management/Pandas and visualization/Matplotlib) and other ones i can easily develop possibly ideally as co-taught classes, there was enthusiasm on co-teaching: Haydee, I-Ming).
<br>

Initial thinking: everybody needs to take intro and data
  management/Pandas and visualization/Matplotlib; but  the other 2 core classes: possibly 2 tracks:
  for STEM: CS/math classes  that i am narrowing down (see below); and
  for soc sci/humanities: some lighter more applied equivalents: i am
  actually happy to develop these from scratch (maybe co-teach with
  dan, paul, sarah, i-ming, jim?) 
<br>

  Initially was thinking about 2 tracks STEM and CSS for core, but after thinking and conversations (esp wih Sunil) decided to go just with one core, and then people can satisfy SETM v CSS and domain area through electives
<br>

<h1>actual program description starts here</h1>

Welcome to 12 credit certificate / 30 credit MS in data science!
30 hour MS curriculum consists of 15 hours of core, 9 hours of
electives, and 6 hours of practicum/capstone/thesis.
<br><br>

<img src="cbd_0101-32eeb561.png">

All core classes are taught in Python, with possible small additions of other software. Electives vary.

<dl>Everyone needs to complete short common core, and then pick 
electives possibly mostly either from one of (though can combine):
  <li> STEM data science: computer science/math/engineering/science
    (lead: haydee, sunil) 
  <li> CSS data science: Computational Social Science (and Humanities) (lead: adam, dan)
</dl>

    probability, etc) [co-taught adam, sunil?] <u>text: manual (initial chapters)</u>
  <li> [1st sem] basic applied math using Python for data science, taught by math dept, say Haydee or Debashis, maybe based on 56:645:549-550 Linear Algebra and Applications; <u>text: thinkstats2</u>

<h3>do i need math?</h3>

Yes, you need some, and ideally the more the better--math makes your transcript and CV look good--shows you can think logically with numbers--yet much math is not necessary, if you don't think better with math or have a "math block" you'll only have to take most basic math. And surely there is some "math fetish"--pushing use of math for the sake of it because it looks good. And surely math does disservice to many people and creates anxiety as opposed to learning. Yet, also for many math does help and initial math block is often illusory--a person is afraid until she tries it and it works. 

Hence, only basic math is required, but there's plenty of math offered
as electives.
