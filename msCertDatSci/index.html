Welcome to certificate/MS in data science!<br><br>

All core classes are taught in Python, with possible small additions of other software. Electives vary.

<dl>Everyone needs to complete short common core, and then pick 
electives possibly mostly either from one of (though can combine):
<li> STEM data science: computer science/math/engineering/science
  (lead: haydee, sunil) 
<li> CSS data science: Computational Social Science (and Humanities) (lead: adam, dan)
</dl>

<dl> <b>core classes (Python) 12 credits (4classes*3credits)
    [certificate: these 4 or 3+1elective]</b>
<li> intro: theory, Py basics and math: co-taught adam, haydee?,  sunil?
<li> data management/Pandas and visualization/Matplotlib: adam
<li> data structures/databases/big data/alghoritms: sunil
<li> one more: maybe iming's et al machine learning or similar from CS
</dl>

<h4>do i need math?</h4>

Yes, you need some, and ideally the more the better--math makes your transcript and CV look good--shows you can think logically with numbers--yet much math is not necessary, if you don't think better with math or have a "math block" you'll only have to take most basic math. And surely there is some "math fetish"--pushing use of math for the sake of it because it looks good. And surely math does disservice to many people and creates anxiety as opposed to learning. Yet, also for many math does help and initial math block is often illusory--a person is afraid until she tries it and it works.
