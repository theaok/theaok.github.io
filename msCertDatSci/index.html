Welcome to 12 credit certificate / 30 credit MS in data science!
<br><br>

30 hour MS curriculum contains 15 hours of core: Python scripting, basic statistics/math, data management, and visualization; 9 hours of electives (extending
programming+statistics/math and/or fulfilling "domain" (substantive expertise) part of the
Venn diagram), and 3 hours of internship and 3 hours of
practicum/capstone/thesis.
<br><br>

12 hour certificate requires at least 2 (we recommend all  3) core
classes + 2 (or 1) electives. <!-- ; <font color="blue">yes, we need to redo  our certificate!!</font>] -->
<br><br>

All core classes are taught in Python.<!-- , with possible small --
				-- additions of other software. -->
Electives vary. RU-Camden has a dedicated <a href="https://theaok.github.io/lab/">data science lab.</a>
<br><br>

<!-- <dl>Everyone needs to complete short common core, and then pick  -->
<!-- electives possibly mostly either from one of (though can combine): -->

<h2>mandatory internship <!-- to use skill in the real world --> (3 credits)</h2>
<!-- sunil's idea: pipeline: help to connect with industry YES! great idee-->

This is important part of curriculum--it builds link between curriculum and application:
helps graduates to find a job and then possibly hire more graduates and also helps us to
see what are the industry needs and trends.
<br><br>
In special circumstances if internship is not possible this can be replaced with addition 3 hours of the following (practicum/real world project for practitioners  OR capstone/thesis/independent study  for researchers)
<br>

<h1>what makes us different</h1>

We are trully interdisciplinary and we will fit your profile.  Program faculty come from the following fields: math/statistics, computer science, social science, and humanities. <br><br>

Our program is not just data science itself but we combine it with
substantive fields and prepare people to work specifically in these
fields so our distinguishing feature and comparative advantage
is small core and plenty of tracks/specializations that involve classes
form our dept. <br><br> <!-- TODO: do org classes by tracks! -->


We focus on flexibility: everyone is at least a little different and we want to accommodate that--only five core classes and electives as opposed to other programs where majority is core. Also value hands on experience: internship/practicum. We focus on Python, and supplement it with R. <br><br>

For the sake of added flexibility, we supplement/complement the
curriculum  with workshops/labs. <br><br>
<!--Engaging students in real-world problems through collaborative Rutgers-Camden Data Science Labs, industry partnerships/practicums internships and collaboration with major organizations and agencies in the Philadelphia/South Jersey metropolitan corridor. The point is that any organization, public sector, nonprofits etc, not just typical businesses, has the data and needs data science, and we will prepare our graduates to fit their data needs, too.-->

We also offer a 12 hour certificate. <br><br>


We focus on skills and application, we want you to be able to do
things. We won’t waste time on unnecessary stuff. To that end our core
classes are completely new and designed specifically for this degree
(not redesigned existing classes or worse yet a collection of existing
classes made for other purposes). <br><br>

There is an argument to be made that  "data science" is mostly about
cleaning, shaping data, and moving it from place to place. And we
acknowledge it and provide a thorough and dedicated class to teach you
the right skills.

<h3>do i need math?</h3>

<!-- by haydee -->
Mathematics is the universal language of science. It is the foundation of many breakthroughs in science, engineering, and finance.  Mathematics enables us to analyze and model physical and social phenomena quantitatively and logically and provides us the tools to solve them. Many jobs in today’s economy require analytic and quantitative skills. The math and statistics courses in this program equips the students with techniques and machineries to succeed in their professional careers.    
<br><br>

Hence, yes, you need some math, and ideally the more the better--math makes your transcript and CV look good--shows you can think logically with numbers--yet much math is not necessary, if you don't think better with math or have a "math block" you'll only have to take most basic math. <!-- And surely there is some "math fetish"--pushing use of math for the sake of it because it looks good. And surely math does disservice to many people and creates anxiety as opposed to learning. --> Yet, also for many math does help and initial math block is often illusory--a person is afraid until she tries it and it works. 
<br><br>

To summarize, only basic math is required, but there's plenty of math offered
as electives. We recommend taking as much math as possible/useful/practicable.

<h1>actual program description ends here</h1>

<h2>pondering ideas, thinking, logic </h2>

<h3>General points/philosophy</h3>

Philosophy is to have as much variety from across FASC in core as possible so it's truly interdisciplinary and students get different perspectives and also get to know different dept and better able to choose electives.

  <!-- Interdisciplinary and inclusive as possible (maybe complicating this -->
  <!-- too much!) and so far had actually unexpectedly great -->
  <!-- discussions with people from across FASC, pretty much everyone -->
  <!-- excited AND also willing to compromise.   -->
<br>

Note that Python over R is a choice (just for core,
  not electives), but i have a
  ton of recent evidence that Python is better, just one here, scroll
  to table mid page https://mbs.rutgers.edu/program/analytics-discovery-informatics-data-sciences 

<h3>STEM v CSS</h3>

However, looks like there
  are 2 camps: STEM v soc sci/humanities, and so maybe lets have 2
  tracks. This is what i think Ray was also kind of suggesting. And
  this is what others do, eg NB has 3 tracks:
  https://mbs.rutgers.edu/program/analytics-discovery-informatics-data-sciences
  but we allow more flexibility with courses.
This would allow flexibility and having everyone on board and this could actually be our comparative advantage over competition that we have truly interdisciplinary program. Also, it is easy: most classes already exist, just have to develop 3-4 new classes for the core: I have one almost already ready (data management/Pandas and visualization/Matplotlib) and other ones i can easily develop possibly ideally as co-taught classes, there was enthusiasm on co-teaching: Haydee, I-Ming).
<br><br>

Initial thinking: everybody needs to take intro and data
  management/Pandas and visualization/Matplotlib; but  the other 2 core classes: possibly 2 tracks:
  for STEM: CS/math classes  that i am narrowing down (see below); and
  for soc sci/humanities: some lighter more applied equivalents: i am
  actually happy to develop these from scratch (maybe co-teach with
  dan, paul, i-ming, jim?) 
<br><br>

  Initially was thinking about 2 tracks STEM and CSS for core, but after thinking and conversations (esp with Sunil) decided to go just with one core, and then people can satisfy STEM v CSS and domain area through electives
<br><br>

Then increased number of core classes to 5 as was thinking about useful stuff, and then cut back to 3: this allows more flexibility and just most important stuff
