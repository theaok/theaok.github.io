Welcome to certificate/MS in data science!<br><br>

All core classes are taught in Python, with possible small additions of other software. Electives vary.

<dl>Everyone needs to complete short common core, and then pick 
electives possibly mostly either from one of (though can combine):
<li> STEM data science: computer science/math/engineering/science
  (lead: haydee, sunil) 
<li> CSS data science: Computational Social Science (and Humanities) (lead: adam, dan)
</dl>

<dl> <b>core classes (Python) 12 credits (4classes*3credits)
    [certificate: these 4 or 3+1elective]</b>
<li> intro: theory, Py basics and math: co-taught adam, haydee?,  sunil?
<li> data management/Pandas and visualization/Matplotlib: adam
<li> data structures/databases/big data/alghoritms: sunil
<li> one more: maybe iming's et al machine learning or similar from CS
</dl>

<!-- dan had a great point : the downside of this, imo, is that it's a lot -->
<!-- of credits for students who won't be that interested in traditional -->
<!-- research projects. some sort of internship might be -->
<!-- better. psychology's perspective is that it can be a little hard to do -->
<!-- theses with students who really aren't that interested in research. -->
