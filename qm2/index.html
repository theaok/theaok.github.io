<!-- <h3>Course Description</h3> -->

<!-- This course provides a survey of the bivariate and multiple regression models estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), with an emphasis on using regression models to test social and economic hypotheses. This application focused course presents examples drawn from economics, political science, public policy and sociology, introduces the basic concepts and interpretation of regression models, and basic methods of inference. Topics are supported by computer-supported data analyses.  -->

<h3>philosophy</h3>

Do talk to me about challenges at the beginning! I can accomodate much
of it, if you tell me early. Don't wait till the end of the course!
Material is cumulative, if you fall behind, it may be fatal.
<br><br>

Not much wiggle room as in other classes:  a core
required class that will be tested again in qualifying exam. <!-- You all -->
<!-- need to learn regression, and for a good reason, even if you end up -->
<!-- not using it in your research: it is most popular technique in social science! -->
 Still,  everyone is different
(also in this class), and I will try to accomodate that. While there
is only one way to excel (learn the material), there is 
opportunity for extra credit. You can do (extra) math,
(extra) statistical programing, civic engagement, having great
research ideas and paper. Try to produce a publishable paper.

<h3>overview</h3>

<!--  This is a course on empirical methods that are useful in the investigation of -->
<!-- hypotheses in the social sciences and, for instance,  the analysis of -->
<!-- public policies and programs. --> 
Class is about Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, with social
science focus.

<!-- Topics include: violations of OLS assumptions and the use -->
<!-- of dummy variables. --> <!-- Throughout, examples are drawn from the literature -->
<!-- so students can see the models and methods in action. --> This class uses
 Stata: regression cannot be learnt in an applied way without some
use of software.<br>

We will also cover some research design approaches like Difference in
Difference models. 


<h3>student learning objectives/outcomes</h3>
<ul>
  <li> understand principles  and mechanics of regression
  <li> analyze the wealth of data now available using regression
  <li> understand/interpret regression results 
</ul>

<h3>pre-requisites</h3>

QM1 or the equivalent knowledge. You are expected to be familiar with basic descriptive and inferential
statistics. Do not need any knowledge of regression. 
<!-- If you wish to -->
<!-- review probability and statistics before or during the class, I -->
<!-- recommend <a href="https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php">https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php</a>. A solid -->
<!-- foundation in basic mathematics and college algebra is essential, but you do not need to know -->
<!-- calculus or matrix algebra. -->


<h3>communication</h3>

Everything is linked from online
syllabus (this page). Canvas is only used for discussions/forum and as
assignment dropbox.   
<!-- A preferred mode of communication is listserv-just email -->
<!-- qm2_class@googlegroups.com and everyone in the class will get it -->
<!-- including TA and myself.  -->

<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li> Students will learn the practice of data management (there will be some theory, too) -->
<!-- <li> Students will learn how to conduct reproducible research  -->
<!-- <li> Students will learn how to automate research by programming in Stata -->
<!-- <li> Students will demonstrate mastery of the material by writing an empirical paper using learned -->
<!--   data management techniques. You may cowrite papers (upto 3 people) but then the paper quality needs to by upto 3 times of a single-authored paper. -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<h3>required textbooks</h3>

none

<!-- have for each syllabus for books maybe articles too a py sript that -->
<!-- would pull them up into a file and then just have input statement -->
<!-- under books... -->

<h3>software</h3>

We will use Stata 18. <!-- (Intercooled/IC or higher: SE or MP) do -->
<!-- not use 'small' stata. Older versions (>10) are fine). -->
Stata is in the classroom, the Library, and online virtual lab: <a href="https://it.rutgers.edu/virtual-computer-labs">https://it.rutgers.edu/virtual-computer-labs</a> <br><br>
You can buy your own Stata  <!-- 15 IC/Intercooled  --> with perpetual
license for about $200 <a href="https://www.stata.com/order/new/edu/profplus/student-pricing/">https://www.stata.com/order/new/edu/profplus/student-pricing/</a><br><br>
If you use Python or R no need for Stata (I just use it in class). <br><br>

<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- You may also use -->
<!-- <\!-- free R -\-> -->
<!-- <\!--  <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">http://cran.r-project.org</a>; -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- or -\->  -->
<!-- free  Python <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a>, -->
<!--  but I will cover only Stata.  -->
<!-- <br><br> -->


<!-- Stata is available at apps.rutgers [note there is also camden apps...]. First make sure you have it -->
<!-- enabled: <a href="http://netid.rutgers.edu/">http://netid.rutgers.edu</a>, on the left, click ``service activation'', and activate ``apps cloud service''. -->
<!-- Then connect to apps.rutgers. Go -->
<!-- to <a href="https://apps.rutgers.edu">https://apps.rutgers.edu</a>. To -->
<!-- copy files between your computer and apps just use something -->
<!-- like <a href="https://www.google.com/drive">https://www.google.com/drive</a> -->
<!-- or <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">https://www.dropbox.com</a> -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- It is mainly clunky because of fixed screen size, but you can adjust -->
<!-- geometry!!: i like netid:geom=1400x700 for my laptop (note: make sure -->
<!-- you first logout out of old resolution and do uncheck save it for -->
<!-- later!!); also make webbrowser full screen!; let's do all that [https://rutgersit.rutgers.edu/top-4-myths-regarding-apps-rutgers-edu/] -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Some people can download Stata for free (probably need to be employed -->
<!-- at RU) from <a href="https://software.rutgers.edu/">https://software.rutgers.edu/</a>. -->



<h3>calculator</h3>

A hand calculator is necessary for midterm. It does not have to be fancy, just
 the most basic functions. It's about $10.

<h3>requirements</h3>

<u>problem sets:</u> To learn the material work on
problems that reinforce the material.  Late problem sets are not
accepted (except documented emergency eg hospitalization). Can work in groups but must be <b>separately written</b>.<br>
<!-- Problem sets are due -->
<!-- by the midnight of the day preceding the class by email to the TA -->
<!-- (if you handwrite your problem set -- you can scan it or just take a picture)<br><br> -->

<u>tests:</u>  Open-book, open-note midterm. Calculator is necessary. Laptops/phones/etc not allowed.<br>

<u>paper:</u> Use tools from the class to produce a paper
<b>no longer than 10 pages single-spaced.</b> 
 Can have a more
typical journal article length, say 10-15 single spaced pages,
 especially if you have already done some work on a topic and
continue  in this class (recommended). But please do contact me as early as possible. Can co-author in groups of
upto <b>3</b> people: group submits one paper (and presentation). (But
 has to be up to 3x better).
<!-- Typically, this paper needs to -->
<!-- engage civically (see civic engagement component section). It can a be -->
<!-- purely academic paper (no civic engagement) but that raises the rigor -->
<!-- bar higher. Such paper has to use multiple regression or use extremely -->
<!-- sophisticated descriptive statistics. -->


<h3>grading</h3>

<!-- I guess fewer ps and add midterm; jargo had midterm! -->
<!-- TODO consider maybe less focus on paper , this is initial class -->
<ul>
  <li>  problem sets   50  (5ps*10pts; 1 or 2 ps will be presentations) <!-- (+1ps for extra credit) -->
  <!-- <li> Midterm	       30 percent -->
  <!-- <li> Quizzes         15 percent -->
  <!-- <li> Attendance      10 percent -->
  <!-- <li> quiz            15 (2*7.5) -->
  <li> midterm         25 
  <!-- <li> presentation    10  -->
  <li> empirical paper 25
</ul>
<!-- because we have a strict policy on problem set submission [no late ps accepted except documented emergency], it does not allow enough flexibility for random, external, etc events that affect all of us and are not emergencies. Hence, there will be one more problem set that is counted as extra credit, and is worth as much as one ps--it would make up for points you might have lost on other graded parts of the class. For instance, if you do not submit one problem set, this new extra credit problem set will make up for that. Effectively, what it means is that you may just forget about one problem set.  -->


<!-- Given the nature of the material and the grading structure, the best way to do well in this course -->
<!-- is to work steadily throughout the semester. -->



<!-- LATER have sometjing like this -->
<!-- Starting in Fall of 2008, certain plus and minus grades will be allowed for graduate -->
<!-- courses. After computing the student semester average on a 100-point numeric scale, -->
<!-- letter grades will be assigned as follows: -->


<table BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1 RULES=ROWS FRAME=HSIDES><tr><td>    
min</td><td> max</td><td> grade</td><tr><td>
90.0</td><td>100.0</td><td>A   </td><tr><td>
85.0</td><td>89.9</td><td>B+   </td><tr><td>
80.0</td><td>84.9</td><td>B    </td><tr><td>
75.0</td><td>79.9</td><td>C+   </td><tr><td>
70.0</td><td>74.9</td><td>C    </td><tr><td>
0</td><td>69.9</td><td>F       </td></table>

<!-- <h3>Course & Instructor Policies</h3> -->

<!-- <h4>Attendance</h4> -->

<!-- Attendance is mandatory.  The material covered in the -->
<!-- lectures is essential to passing the course. You are responsible for all material covered in the -->
<!-- lectures whether or not it is in the textbook. You are also responsible for all announcements -->
<!-- made in class, whether or not you attend. There will be few quizzes, and if you miss -->
<!-- them you will get 0 points. If you -->
<!-- have to miss a class, due to illness or other unavoidable conflict, try to borrow a fellow student's -->
<!-- notes. -->

<!-- <h4>Academic Honesty Notice</h4> -->

<!-- There can be absolutely no collaboration of any kind -->
<!-- on examinations. This includes communication of any kind, sharing of books or -->
<!-- notes, or sharing of calculators. Similarly, students must scrupulously avoid -->
<!-- plagiarism on the final paper. The penalty I request in cases of academic -->
<!-- dishonesty is a grade of zero (0) for the examination or assignment in question, -->
<!-- although the final penalty is determined by the responsible university official. A -->
<!-- grade of zero on an exam could lead to failing the course. In addition, the -->
<!-- incident is reported to the Dean of Students for disposition and becomes a part of -->
<!-- the student’s record. -->

<!-- <h4>Lab Computers and Laptop Computers</h4> -->

<!-- Laptop computers may be used in class, but only for class purposes. Class -->
<!-- purposes include taking notes, working with Stata, and viewing lecture notes or research articles -->
<!-- as they are discussed in class. You may not use laptop computers to text, IM, surf the web, -->
<!-- answer emails, do assignments for other classes, or any other purpose. Such uses interfere with -->
<!-- your learning and distract fellow students. Students who violate these -->
<!-- rules will be prohibited from further laptop use. -->

  <li> a review class...<b>bring your questions!</b>--im all yours
   <li> make sure everyone is up-to-speed on material so far: 
   review especially logs, quadratics, and multiple regression
  interpretation;  open critical slides from advanced measurment and run examples in Stata and interpret them
<li> interactions (and in general): think about it, what does it mean,
  what is the  bottom line, eg why is there a synergy between 2 vars;
  so not just mechanistic interpretation: unit increase in x produces
  ? change in y; but tell me what does it really mean; and related:
  talk briefly about practical significance or effect sizes; see reg
  in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/adamokuliczkozaryn/pubs/ee_ls.pdf">ee_ls.pdf</a>
<li> definitely revisit interactions, they did not go great :( run and
  discuss examples from <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~rwilliam/stats2/l51.pdf">https://www3.nd.edu/~rwilliam/stats2/l51.pdf</a>

much of an outline; do not be shy, publish your research; use
pictures, use maps, tell a story, do not overwhelm user, present most
important key results, not everything!! be interesting; but have well
thought regression results!! this is regression class: need
regression results

<!-- <h3>The material that follows is standard text recommended by the University</h3> -->

<!-- <h4>Student Conduct & Discipline</h4> -->

<!-- The University of Texas System and The University of Texas at Dallas have rules and regulations for the orderly and -->
<!-- efficient conduct of their business. It is the responsibility of each student and each student organization to be -->
<!-- knowledgeable about the rules and regulations which govern student conduct and activities. General information on -->
<!-- student conduct and discipline is contained in the UTD publication, A to Z Guide, which is provided to all registered -->
<!-- students each academic year. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- The University of Texas at Dallas administers student discipline within the procedures of recognized and established -->
<!-- due process. Procedures are defined and described in the Rules and Regulations, Board of Regents, The University of -->
<!-- Texas System, Part 1, Chapter VI, Section 3, and in Title V, Rules on Student Services and Activities of the university's -->
<!-- Handbook of Operating Procedures. Copies of these rules and regulations are available to students in the Office of the -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Dean of Students, where staff members are available to assist students in interpreting the rules and regulations (SU -->
<!-- 1.602, 972/883-6391). -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- A student at the university neither loses the rights nor escapes the responsibilities of citizenship. He or she is expected -->
<!-- to obey federal, state, and local laws as well as the Regents' Rules, university regulations, and administrative rules. -->
<!-- Students are subject to discipline for violating the standards of conduct whether such conduct takes place on or off -->
<!-- campus, or whether civil or criminal penalties are also imposed for such conduct. -->

<!-- <h4>Academic Integrity</h4> -->

<!-- The faculty expects from its students a high level of responsibility and academic honesty. Because the value of an -->
<!-- academic degree depends upon the absolute integrity of the work done by the student for that degree, it is imperative -->
<!-- that a student demonstrate a high standard of individual honor in his or her scholastic work. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, statements, acts or omissions related to applications for enrollment -->
<!-- or the award of a degree, and/or the submission as one's own work or material that is not one's own. As a general rule, -->
<!-- scholastic dishonesty involves one of the following acts: cheating, plagiarism, collusion and/or falsifying academic -->
<!-- records. Students suspected of academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary proceedings. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Plagiarism, especially from the web, from portions of papers for other classes, and from any other source is -->
<!-- unacceptable and will be dealt with under the university's policy on plagiarism (see general catalog for details). This -->
<!-- course will use the resources of turnitin.com, which searches the web for possible plagiarism and is over 90% effective. -->

<!-- <h4>Withdrawal from Class</h4> -->

<!-- The administration of this institution has set deadlines for withdrawal of any college-level courses. These dates and -->
<!-- times are published in that semester's course catalog. Administration procedures must be followed. It is the student's -->
<!-- responsibility to handle withdrawal requirements from any class. In other words, I cannot drop or withdraw any -->
<!-- student. You must do the proper paperwork to ensure that you will not receive a final grade of "F" in a course if you -->
<!-- choose not to attend the class once you are enrolled. -->

<!-- <h4>Student Grievance Procedures</h4> -->

<!-- Procedures for student grievances are found in Title V, Rules on Student Services and Activities, of the university's -->
<!-- Handbook of Operating Procedures. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- In attempting to resolve any student grievance regarding grades, evaluations, or other fulfillments of academic -->
<!-- responsibility, it is the obligation of the student first to make a serious effort to resolve the matter with the instructor, -->
<!-- supervisor, administrator, or committee with whom the grievance originates (hereafter called "the respondent"). -->
<!-- Individual faculty members retain primary responsibility for assigning grades and evaluations. If the matter cannot be -->
<!-- resolved at that level, the grievance must be submitted in writing to the respondent with a copy of the respondent's -->
<!-- School Dean. If the matter is not resolved by the written response provided by the respondent, the student may submit -->
<!-- a written appeal to the School Dean. If the grievance is not resolved by the School Dean's decision, the student may -->
<!-- make a written appeal to the Dean of Graduate or Undergraduate Education, and the deal will appoint and convene an -->
<!-- Academic Appeals Panel. The decision of the Academic Appeals Panel is final. The results of the academic appeals -->
<!-- process will be distributed to all involved parties. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Copies of these rules and regulations are available to students in the Office of the Dean of Students, where staff -->
<!-- members are available to assist students in interpreting the rules and regulations. -->

<!-- <h4>Incomplete Grade Policy</h4> -->

<!-- As per university policy, incomplete grades will be granted only for work unavoidably missed at the semester's end and -->
<!-- only if 70\% of the course work has been completed. An incomplete grade must be resolved within eight (8) weeks -->
<!-- from the first day of the subsequent long semester. If the required work to complete the course and to remove the -->
<!-- incomplete grade is not submitted by the specified deadline, the incomplete grade is changed automatically to a grade -->
<!-- of F. -->

<!-- <h4>Disability Services</h4> -->

<!-- The goal of Disability Services is to provide students with disabilities educational opportunities equal to those of their -->
<!-- non-disabled peers. Disability Services is located in room 1.610 in the Student Union. Office hours are Monday and -->
<!-- Thursday, 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Tuesday and Wednesday, 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; and Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- The contact information for the Office of Disability Services is: -->

<!-- The University of Texas at Dallas, SU 22 -->
<!-- PO Box 830688 -->
<!-- Richardson, Texas 75083-0688 -->
<!-- (972) 883-2098 (voice or TTY) -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Essentially, the law requires that colleges and universities make those reasonable adjustments necessary to eliminate -->
<!-- discrimination on the basis of disability. For example, it may be necessary to remove classroom prohibitions against -->
<!-- tape recorders or animals (in the case of dog guides) for students who are blind. Occasionally an assignment -->
<!-- requirement may be substituted (for example, a research paper versus an oral presentation for a student who is hearing -->
<!-- impaired). Classes enrolled students with mobility impairments may have to be rescheduled in accessible facilities. -->
<!-- The college or university may need to provide special services such as registration, note-taking, or mobility assistance. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- It is the student's responsibility to notify his or her professors of the need for such an accommodation. Disability -->
<!-- Services provides students with letters to present to faculty members to verify that the student has a disability and needs -->
<!-- accommodations. Individuals requiring special accommodation should contact the professor after class or during office -->
<!-- hours. -->

<!-- <h4>Religious Holy Days</h4> -->

<!-- The University of Texas at Dallas will excuse a student from class or other required activities for the travel to and -->
<!-- observance of a religious holy day for a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property tax under Section -->
<!-- 11.20, Tax Code, Texas Code Annotated. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- The student is encouraged to notify the instructor or activity sponsor as soon as possible regarding the absence, -->
<!-- preferably in advance of the assignment. The student, so excused, will be allowed to take the exam or complete the -->
<!-- assignment within a reasonable time after the absence: a period equal to the length of the absence, up to a maximum of -->
<!-- one week. A student who notifies the instructor and completes any missed exam or assignment may not be penalized -->
<!-- for the absence. A student who fails to complete the exam or assignment within the prescribed period may receive a -->
<!-- failing grade for that exam or assignment. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- If a student or an instructor disagrees about the nature of the absence [i.e., for the purpose of observing a religious holy -->
<!-- day] or if there is similar disagreement about whether the student has been given a reasonable time to complete any -->
<!-- missed assignments or examinations, either the student or the instructor may request a ruling from the chief executive -->
<!-- officer of the institution, or his or her designee. The chief executive officer or designee must take into account the -->
<!-- legislative intent of TEC 51.911(b), and the student and instructor will abide by the decision of the chief executive -->
<!-- officer or designee. -->

<!-- A decent text editor is an important tool for data analyst. You can use it to write/edit your statistical code (Do NOT write/edit code in MS Word !), but also to look at your data if data are in text format (e.g. .dat .txt .csv .tab . raw ). Statistical software usually comes with text editor. For instance, Stata has a built-in do-file editor. But these built-in text editors are poor as compared to stand-alone text editors. Using stand-alone text editor is more efficient: -->
<!-- You can define your own syntax highlighting (or use predefined) -->
<!-- You can manipulate your code using regular expressions -->
<!-- You can use many advanced features such as autocompletion, multi-view, bookmarks, macros, etc. -->
<!-- There are many text-editors out there. If you use windows, you have Notepad preinstalled, but Notepad is a really poor software like most Microsoft products. There is a good review of text editors for Stata (it is also useful if you use other software): http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html -->
<!-- I experimented with many text editors. If you use Windows, a good choice is Notepad++: http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm. -->
<!-- If you use Stata, you can actually run it from within Notepad++: -->
<!-- http://web.mit.edu/randallL/www/STATA.html and/or http://econweb.umd.edu/~kranker/code/notepad_to_stata.php -->

<!-- If you want really advanced (with really big learning curve) text editor, a good choice is Emacs: -->
<!-- http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs. You should also then get Emacs Speaks Statistics: -->
<!-- http://ess.r-project.org/ Another powerful text editor is Vim. -->

<!-- Spending time on learning text editor is a well-invested time. If you use windows, a really good -->
<!-- choice is notepad++  -->

<!-- You will see below that integrating npp with other software takes a little hacking around... -->

<u>do not share or link to class videos!</u>

Rutgers University and the Professor grant you a license only to replay them for your own personal use during the course. Sharing them with others (including other students), reproducing, distributing, or posting any part of them elsewhere -- including but not limited to any internet site -- will be treated as a copyright violation and an offense against the honesty provisions of the Code of Student Conduct. <br><br> 

<u>doing research with humans and other animals</u>
If you use data collected by someone else, you are fine. If you
collect your own data, do experiments, or in any way do anything with
human subjects or other animals, see <a href="https://eirb.rutgers.edu">https://eirb.rutgers.edu</a><br><br> 

<u>confidential data</u>
If you have, handle, or plan to use or collect anyy data that is in
any way confidential, eg: SSN, DOB, phone\#, address, name, etc: talk
to me first!<br><br> 


<u>attendance</u>
 Attendance is  recommended.  You are
responsible for any material covered in the class, whether or not it was in the readings or
lecture notes. You are also responsible for any announcements made in class. For most
students, attendance is simply essential to learning the material. If you do need to miss a
class, be sure to consult with a fellow student to learn what transpired.<br><br> 

<u>incompletes</u> The material  is best learned as a single unit. Incompletes given only in cases where a substantial change in life circumstances occurs that
is beyond the control of the student, and only with documentation.<br><br> 

<u>study groups</u> Very helpful! You're also encouraged to work on
 problem sets and final project together. However, each  student must
 write up her own answers, based on  her own understanding of the
 material. Do not hand in a copy of another person's problem set, even a member of your own group. Writing up your own
answer helps you to internalize the group discussions and is a crucial
step in the learning process. Also, if worked in group, spell out
group members' names next to your name. You can also submit <b>the same</b> presentation and paper in a group of upto <b><u>3 people</u></b>. So your group
would hand in one presentation and paper, but everyone would
 hand in her own problem set that must differ from others [except problem sets
that are drafts of final project; essp the later ones].<br><br>

<u>academic integrity</u> I am very serious about this. Make no
mistake--I may appear accommodating and  informal--but I am extremely
strict about academic integrity.   Violations of academic integrity include cheating on tests or handing in
assignments that do not reflect your own work and/or the work of a study group in which you
actively participated. Handing in your own work that was performed not
for this class (e.g. other class, any other project) is cheating,
too. I have a policy of zero tolerance for cheating. Violations are
always referred to the university authorities. <br><br>

<u>accommodating students with disabilities</u> Any student with a disability affecting performance in the class
should contact the disability office ASAP: <a href="https://success.camden.rutgers.edu/success-services/disability-services/">https://success.camden.rutgers.edu/success-services/disability-services/</a>

<h3>civic engagement component</h3>
<!-- We meet every second week, during the weeks that we do not meet I will -->

<h4>typical civic engagement</h4>

Universities and social science should serve society. This idea will
be enforced in this class through graded civic engagement. You will
have to engage with local community. <br><br>

The idea is that you engage civically using data. There are several
ways to do it. Ideally, you will partner with a local organization,
obtain data from them  and present results to them. You may also use
government data, say from census bureau, and present relevant
information to locals. A local organization can be Rutgers research
institute such as WRI, CURE, LEAP or any other organization such as
school or soup kitchen or CamConnect-Rutgers Office of civic engagement will help
 you contact them. The key idea is partnership:  you will use tools 
 from this class to produce output useful to local community. This 
is similar to taking a role of an apprentice at a local organization
or serving as a consultant.		     
<br><br>
Details will follow in specific assignments. Using
real world data poses challenges, which is a part of
exercise. Presenting your findings to stakeholders outside of a class
is also challenging. At the same time, it is fairly easy to contribute
locally by using simple tools learned in this class. For instance,
simple comparison of means between two schools in Camden can be
revealing and helpful locally.
<br><br>

An obvious way would be to use data at your workplace or at a
workplace of someone you know. However, you need to make sure that it
serves society in some way. For instance, it would be straightforward
if you work at a hospital or school or fire department; but it would
be difficult if you work at Starbucks.
<br><br>

There will be two or three civic engagement ps and paper has a civic
engagement part: you will probably need
to spend estimated 30-50 hours total this semester on these
assignments outside of the class.
<br><br>



<h4>atypical civic engagement</h4>

Successful completion of atypical civic engagement will take estimated at
least double of the typical civic engagement time.

<br><br>

An apparently straightforward solution is to engage with
international academic community by producing research, but this is a
good idea only if you can produce an innovative research, which is
 difficult (but possible). To do this successfully, you'd need
to be very sophisticated at academic research. It is easier to
contribute locally (traditional civic engagement) than internationally.<br><br>

Somewhat easier would be engagement at regional or State level-for
instance, you may evaluate some policy in NJ as compared to NY, or
produce descriptive statistics of a region that would be useful
regionally (e.g. my South Jersey WRI presentation). Again,
this type of engagement typically requires substantial research
experience typically found at late stage of PhD program.

<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Another atypical way to meet civic engagement requirement is to help me -->
<!-- organize and catalog civic engagement datasets-you will be tasked -->
<!-- with finding useful datasets, and producing a detailed description of -->
<!-- them (metadata), researching those datasets and applying appropriate -->
<!-- tags. <br><br> -->

There may also be some other atypical ways-let me know your ideas.
