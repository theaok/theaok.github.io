<h4>prerequisites</h4>

No prerequisites, but ability to learn programming is necessary. You need to be comfortable using a computer. Knowledge of Python and/or computer science/programming/scripting is helpful but not necessary. We will cover the basics. 

<b>note to social science/humanities students:</b>
 This class is mostly coding/programming/scripting. <!-- if computers are -->
<!-- not your thing, the class is probably not for you. -->
If you do not like programming, this class is not for you. But you may not yet know
whether you like it and you may start liking it in this class: it often happened before!
<!-- You will need to set aside plenty of time for this class, definitely more than 10hrs per -->
<!-- week outside of classroom.   -->

Warning for people new to coding!: dont get behind.<!-- : learning curve will be steep --> <!-- ; make sure -->
<!-- you set aside plenty of time<br><br>  -->


<h4>course description</h4>


<!-- The class responds to recent emergence of the data science field and -->
<!-- demand for it both from industry and academia. And Python is arguably -->
<!-- the emerging leading programing language of the field. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->

It is an
interdisciplinary applied data science class focused on visualization, an
integral part of data science. We will also cover online visualization
from within Python (glue lang). Visualization is perhaps the most rewarding part
of data science as it produces insight, "aha moments." It is also perhaps the only part of
data science that involves art: designing graphics.
Some data management will also be covered as
necessary to process data for visualization. We will mostly use Pandas
and Matplotlib (and others building on it). 
<br><br>

  
<!-- Topics include best practices for identifying and using data sources; data cleaning, -->
<!-- combining, organization/documentation, and visualization/reporting.  <\!-- functions, conditional and -- -->
<!-- 				-- loop statements, -\->  -->
<!-- <br><br> -->

Course is relevant for natural and social
science, and quantitative/digital humanities.
<!-- <br><br> -->





<h4>learning objectives/outcomes</h4>


<dl>
<li> data visualization/story telling using graphics (most of the class)
<li> about data (sources, best practices, tips and tricks): this class
  is all about data (you will use the data you chose
  that will serve you well beyond this class!!) 
<li> the basics of the computer programming (Python)
<!-- <li> the practice of data management (there will be some theory, too) -->
<!-- <li> how to conduct reproducible research and how to automate research by programming -->
<!-- <li> GIT, a version control system  -->
</dl>

The key is the mastery of "data story-telling:" 1) What data are
telling, 2) what I want to say, and 3) what audience needs to know<br><br>

<!-- You will demonstrate mastery of the material by writing code for a -->
<!-- project/paper using learned  techniques. -->

<h3>required textbooks and materials</h3>

No required textbooks. All required materials (code, readings) will be provided.

  An useful intro read, i like the breakdown:  Comparison, Composition,
  Distribution, and Relationship;  also by lev of measurment. And see
  bunch of useful links at the bottom. Quite comprehensive/exhaustive,
  almost like python-graph-gallery.com, but in general don't really need all of
  that, say you get 90\% functionality with 10\% of charts. In
  general, there's much fanciness/novelty seekeing resulting in
  proliferation of vis, with little value added and increasing
  probability of getting overwhelmed.

<dl>
<li> We will use Python 3x (>=3.10).

<li> BUT no need to download or install any software: we will run
  Python online in webbrowser in the cloud, so called "Colab" (2
  sections down). But first lets get GitHub running. 
</dl>
<!-- <h5>software: Python</h5> -->
<!-- <dl> -->
<!-- <li> there will be at least 2 classes in the second part of the -->

We will use GitHub to store the Python code in form of a notebook, we
will edit the notebook in colab (next sec).

<dl>
<!-- <li> when submitting ps in git just have one file that you will be -->
<!--   updating for each ps!! [can just call it ps.do] -->

<dl><u>workflow: my comments, diffs, inline response <b>[lets go over this next week again]</b></u>
<li> i will run it in my Colab, edit, and upload back 
<li> diff and response to my comments: actually cleaner and better in
  colab: File-Revision history; <small><small> or clunky in GitHub:
   can click my commit message and see the so called
  diff--the difference between your version and my version: important!
  do make sure to fix it up for next ps, you may even have inline
  response to my comments in your next ps (especially if sth complex
  or if you disagree) </small></small>
<li>  you can <!-- either start another dofile from scratch on -->
  <!-- github.com or you can keep on working with this one--if so then -->
  <!-- download this latest version first, edit it, and upload it back when -->
  <!-- done-- -->dont forget about a meaningful commit message--can keep on
  uploading newer versions as many times as you like 
<li> note: when you click the file, you can then click 'History' and
  see how the file evolved over time :)
<li> a thought about file naming: ps1.ipynb, ps2.ipynb, etc, or
  sections in one file; or just one file and keep it updating throught with new stuff as we go!

<h4>data</h4>
</div>

The class is a bit like an independent study: you will carry out some
research (by doing visualizations).
You need your own data for this class ASAP, the more data and the more
complex, the better. Software will need to load the data straight up
from online! Some data are easily downloadable from online
eg <a href="https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data/stata">https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data/stata</a>,
but many are not. Then you have to put data online yourself [just go
over Git<25mb]:

<h4>advice/requirements and grading</h4>

<dl>
<li> <!-- Strictly speaking an advice, rather than a requirement, but in -->
  <!-- practice really a requirement, as it is virtually impossible to -->
  <!-- succeed otherwise! --> <b>2 keys to success: start early AND ask often many questions; (and study groups: get couple people on zoom, screenshare notebooks, etc)</b> This is a
  software class. It is different from typical soc sci classes! You will get
  stuck often and whenever stuck, email listserv, ask me, ask your
  classmates, as opposed to pulling
  your hair out! And stop by my office, too. Googling (and built-in Gemini)  solves most
  problems but for many things its better to talk to me and your
  classmates; also more social/human, if you talk to computer all the
  time, its not healthy.
<li> There are several problem sets (ps) due the following week after being
  posted (unless indicated otherwise; many ps will be due in 2
  weeks). You will be asked to write some computer code that 
  does something that we covered in the class to your data. You may
  work in groups (<b><=2</b>), but <u>say who you worked with</u>,
  and the more people in the group, the better/longer the code must be.
<li> Final project is like final paper (doing some useful empirical
  quantitative research), except that I only grade code, in fact you can submit
  code only. 			       
<!-- <li> You're encouraged to write an empirical paper/report/etc on any topic<\!--  using one or more of the -\-> -->
<!--   <\!-- techniques covered in this course. A typical paper will be 5 to 20 -\-> -->
<!--   <\!-- double spaced pages -\->. I can give you comments and help with the -->
<!--   paper, and it is a good opportunity to produce a paper. But I will -->
<!--   grade only the code that you wrote to produce the results in your paper. -->
<!-- You will submit not only paper, but also code that produced results in -->
<!--   the paper; in fact, you can just submit the code.   -->
<!--  Ideally, the paper should be submitted to a professional journal for a publication. -->
</dl>

<!-- <h4>grading</h4> -->

<dl>
<li> 100% (5ps x 20%) problem sets  [just Py notebook], may cowrite code (<b>upto 2 people</b>) but then
the project should be <b>2</b> times better than a single-authored one <!-- TODO have 7 next year and make final -->
  <!-- project 30perc -->
<!-- <li> 35% final project  [just another computer code  wrapping previous ps] --> <!-- (code only; incl presentation (code and some output esp graphs<b>2*5%</b>)) -->

<!-- A decent text editor is an important tool for data analyst. You can use it to write/edit your statistical code (Do NOT write/edit code in MS Word !), but also to look at your data if data are in text format (e.g. .dat .txt .csv .tab . raw ). Statistical software usually comes with text editor. For instance, Stata has a built-in do-file editor. But these built-in text editors are poor as compared to stand-alone text editors. Using stand-alone text editor is more efficient: -->
<!-- You can define your own syntax highlighting (or use predefined) -->
<!-- You can manipulate your code using regular expressions -->
<!-- You can use many advanced features such as autocompletion, multi-view, bookmarks, macros, etc. -->
<!-- There are many text-editors out there. If you use windows, you have Notepad preinstalled, but Notepad is a really poor software like most Microsoft products. There is a good review of text editors for Stata (it is also useful if you use other software): http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html -->
<!-- I experimented with many text editors. If you use Windows, a good choice is Notepad++: http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm. -->
<!-- If you use Stata, you can actually run it from within Notepad++: -->
<!-- http://web.mit.edu/randallL/www/STATA.html and/or http://econweb.umd.edu/~kranker/code/notepad_to_stata.php -->

<!-- If you want really advanced (with really big learning curve) text editor, a good choice is Emacs: -->
<!-- http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs. You should also then get Emacs Speaks Statistics: -->
<!-- http://ess.r-project.org/ Another powerful text editor is Vim. -->

<!-- Spending time on learning text editor is a well-invested time. If you use windows, a really good -->
<!-- choice is notepad++  -->

<!-- You will see below that integrating npp with other software takes a little hacking around... -->

<h4>rules</h4>

<u>do not share or link to class videos!</u>
These videocasts and podcasts are the exclusive copyrighted property of Rutgers University and the Professor teaching the course. Rutgers University and the Professor grant you a license only to replay them for your own personal use during the course. Sharing them with others (including other students), reproducing, distributing, or posting any part of them elsewhere -- including but not limited to any internet site -- will be treated as a copyright violation and an offense against the honesty provisions of the Code of Student Conduct. Furthermore, for Law Students, this will be reported by the Law School to the licensing authorities in any jurisdiction in which you may apply to the bar.


<u>attendance</u>
 Attendance is  recommended.  Be advised that you are
responsible for any material covered in the class, whether or not it was in the readings or
lecture notes. You are also responsible for any announcements made in class. For most
students, attendance is simply essential to learning the material. If you do need to miss a
class, be sure to consult with a fellow student to learn what transpired.<br><br> 

<u>incompletes:</u> Generally speaking, the material in this course is best learned as a single unit. I
will grant incompletes only in cases where a substantial change in life circumstances occurs that
is beyond the control of the student, and only with appropriate
documentation.<br><br> 

<u>study groups.</u> You are encouraged to form a regular study group. Many students over the years
have found the study groups to be very helpful. Study groups are permitted and encouraged to
work on the problem sets together. However, each individual student should write up his or her
own answer to hand in, based on his or her own understanding of the material. Do not hand in a
copy of another person’s problem set, even a member of your own group. Writing up your own
answer helps you to internalize the group discussions and is a crucial step in the learning process.<br><br>

<!-- say who you worked with or say worked alone ! -->

<u>Academic Integrity.</u> I am very serious about this. Make no
mistake--I may appear accommodating and  informal--but I am extremely
strict about academic integrity.   Violations of academic integrity include cheating on tests or handing in
assignments that do not reflect your own work and/or the work of a study group in which you
actively participated. Handing in your own work that was performed not
for this class (e.g. other class, any other project) is cheating,
too. I have a policy of zero tolerance for cheating. Violations will be referred
to the appropriate university authorities. <br><br>

<u>Accommodating Students with Disabilities.</u>

Any student with a disability affecting performance in the class
should contact the disability office ASAP: <a href="http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html">http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html</a>
