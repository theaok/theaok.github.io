<h3>prerequisites</h3>

You need to be comfortable using a computer. This class is mostly
about using (GIS) software.

<h3>course description</h3>

This is an introductory GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
course. GIS is a broad subject.
This class is very applied with many 
tutorials and examples using modern GIS software: QGIS. 
You will be able to produce maps, put interesting information in
visually appealing way on the maps,  and conduct
basic research using geographical data in any discipline that uses
such data: e.g.: public policy and administration, sociology,
criminology, and public health/epidemiology. In fact, GIS is useful
in all fields, because no matter what you study it <u>always</u>
takes place somewhere and place matters.  


<h3>course objectives</h3>
<dl>
<li>manage data: import and export vector and raster layers in
  various formats
<li>manipulate data: merge, dissolve, produce centroids, etc 
<li>create professional maps to present data
<li>perform basic geographic analysis, such as correlation is space 
</dl>



<h3>required books</h3>

none

<h3>software</h3>

<h4>QGIS</h4> <!-- free download (best option: user friendly) -->
We will use free QGIS >=2.0, ideally latest one 2.18 'Las Palmas'
(<a href="http://www.qgis.org/">http://www.qgis.org/</a>). You can
download it for free for any operating system.  

<!-- <h4>apps.rutgers (not apps.camden.rutgers.edu) (somewhat clunky; good -->
<!--   for computing enthusiasts)</h4> -->
<!-- See general instructions at <a href="https://oirt.rutgers.edu/software/remotexserver/">https://oirt.rutgers.edu/software/remotexserver/</a> -->
<!-- QGIS is also at apps.rutgers. First make sure you have it -->
<!-- enabled: <a href="http://netid.rutgers.edu/">http://netid.rutgers.edu</a>, on the left, click ``service activation'', and activate ``apps cloud service''. -->
<!-- Then connect to apps.rutgers. Go -->
<!-- to <a href="https://apps.rutgers.edu">https://apps.rutgers.edu</a>. To -->
<!--   copy files  install <a href="http://winscp.net">http://winscp.net</a>, run it -->
<!--   and connect to: Host name: "apps.rutgers.edu"; User name: "your -->
<!--   Rutgers NetID"; Password: "your Rutgers password" -->

<h4>GeoDa</h4>
<!-- A great advantage of QGIS is that it communicates well with Python. We -->
<!-- will cover Python in the second part of class, but -->
<!--  usage of Python  is not necessary for successful completion of this class. -->
<!-- Python is free  <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a> --> We'll
also use GeoDA for spatial statistics later in the course, which is also free and cross-platform <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu/">http://geodacenter.asu.edu/</a>

<h3>rules</h3>

<u>attendance</u>
 Attendance is strongly recommended.<!-- entirely optional. However, --> You are
responsible for everything covered, including lecture, discussions,
 announcements etc. Attendance is usually essential to learning. If you miss a
class, consult with a fellow student to learn what transpired.<br><br> 

<u>incompletes:</u> Like late problem sets, only allowed in documented
emergencies (e.g. hospitalization).
<br><br> 

<u>study groups.</u> Many students over the years
have found the study groups to be very helpful. Study groups are permitted and encouraged to
work on the problem sets together. However, each individual student must write up his or her
own answer to hand in, based on his or her own understanding of the material. Do not hand in a
copy of another person's problem set, even a member of your own group. Writing up your own
answer helps you to internalize the group discussions and is a crucial
step in the learning process. Also, if worked in group, spell out
group members' names next to your name. You can work on problem sets
and on the paper in a group of upto <b><u>2 people</u></b>. So your group
would hand in one paper, but each group member would hand in her own
problem set that must differ from others.<br><br>

<!-- say who you worked with or say worked alone ! -->

<u>academic integrity.</u> I am very serious about this. Make no
mistake--I may appear accommodating and informal--but I am extremely
strict about academic integrity.   Violations of academic integrity include cheating on tests or handing in
assignments that do not reflect your own work and/or the work of a study group in which you
actively participated. Handing in your own work that was performed not
for this class (e.g. other class, any other project) is cheating,
too. I have a policy of zero tolerance for cheating. Violations will be referred
to the appropriate university authorities. 
For more information see <a href="http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy/">http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy</a><br><br>

<u>accommodating students with disabilities.</u>
Any student with a disability affecting performance in the class
should contact the disability office ASAP: <a href="http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html">http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html</a>

<hr />

<h3>description/objectives in terms of "universal competencies" (naspaa) </h3><!-- naspa boilerplate as per that spreadsheet that patrice came up with -->


This class is about management and analysis of geographic data. Students produce maps and interpret them--not only technical correctness is emphasized, but also use of GIS for problem solving and decision making. 
In this class students learn by example. Most, if not all, examples/tutorials/exercises that I provide are about public service. For instance, we use data about education, income inequality and public health indicators. As a part of mapping process, we discuss what these maps mean for  public service/policy.
Maps are about communicating data. An exciting feature of maps is that they can be easily/intuitively understood by everyone if they are produced properly. There is least one class devoted to principles of communication using maps: simplicity/clarity, insight/discovery, relevance/usefulness, etc
The role of (geographic) data in   management/leadership is increasing. Students not only produce maps, but also interpret them, which usually informs decision making. Also,  at least one class is devoted to data sources--I want to show students that no matter what research question or management task they are dealing with, there will be almost always plenty of (geographic) data that can be used.
Mapping is an excellent tool to contribute to policy process. It is emphasized in this class that mapping can be used at least in several ways--e.g., description of a situation, monitoring of a progress/process, inference of a relationship. 

<hr />
<h3>civic engagement component (opportunity for extra credit!)</h3>
<!-- We meet every second week, during the weeks that we do not meet I will -->
<!-- assign material that reinforces what we have covered in the -->
<!-- class. Please use actively the listserv to discuss it-if there is not -->
<!-- much discussion, I will help by posting discussion topics/questions. -->

Start early. Start thinking about how you want to engage civically
today.

<h4>typical civic engagement</h4>

Universities and social science should serve society. <!-- This idea will -->
<!-- be enforced in this class through graded civic engagement (in form of some of -->
<!-- the later ps). --> 
You are encouraged have to engage with local community. <br><br>

The idea is that you engage civically using research methods. There are several
ways to do it. Ideally, you will partner with a local organization,
obtain data from them, do some analysis, and present results to them. You may also use government data, say from census bureau, and present relevant
information to locals. A local organization can be Rutgers research
institute such as WRI, CURE, LEAP or any other organization such as
school or soup kitchen or CamConnect. Rutgers Office of civic
engagement may be able to help
 you contact them. The key idea is partnership:  you will use tools 
 from this class to produce output useful to local community. This 
is similar to taking a role of an apprentice at a local organization
or serving as a consultant.		     
<br><br>
Using
real world data poses challenges, which is a part of
exercise. Presenting your findings to stakeholders outside of a class
is also challenging. At the same time, it is fairly easy to contribute
locally by using simple tools learned in this class. For instance,
simple comparison of means between two schools in Camden can be
revealing and helpful locally.
<br><br>

An obvious way would be to use data at your workplace or at a
workplace of someone you know. However, you need to make sure that it
serves society in some way. For instance, it would be straightforward
if you work at a hospital or school or fire department; but it would
be difficult if you work at Starbucks.
<br><br>

<!-- There will be two or three civic engagement ps and paper has a civic -->
<!-- engagement part: you will probably need -->
<!-- to spend estimated 20-40 hours total this semester on these -->
<!-- assignments outside of the class. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Not all of your paper need to engage civically! A part if fine. -->


<h4>atypical civic engagement--CONTACT ME FIRST if you consider this!</h4>

Successful completion of atypical civic engagement will take estimated at
least double of the typical civic engagement time.

<br><br>

<!-- An apparently straightforward solution is to engage with -->
<!-- international academic community by producing research, but this is a -->
<!-- good idea only if you can produce an innovative research, which is -->
<!-- almost impossible at this stage. To do this successfully, you'd need -->
<!-- to be very sophisticated at academic research. It is easier to -->
<!-- contribute locally (traditional civic engagement) than internationally.<br><br> -->

You could try to engage at regional or State level-for
instance, you may evaluate some policy in NJ as compared to NY, or
produce descriptive statistics of a region that would be useful
regionally (e.g. my South Jersey WRI paper
<a href="http://dept.camden.rutgers.edu/rand-institute/files/changes-across-the-region.pdf">http://dept.camden.rutgers.edu/rand-institute/files/changes-across-the-region.pdf</a>
<!-- presentation <a href="http://wrand.rutgers.edu/files/Adam-Okulicz-Kozaryn-Changes-Across-the-Region.pdf">http://wrand.rutgers.edu/files/Adam-Okulicz-Kozaryn-Changes-Across-the-Region.pdf</a>).  -->
Such type of engagement typically requires substantial research
experience typically found at late stage of PhD program.

<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Another atypical way to engage civically is to help me -->
<!-- organize and catalog civic engagement datasets-you will be tasked -->
<!-- with finding useful datasets, and producing a detailed description of -->
<!-- them (metadata), researching those datasets and applying appropriate -->
<!-- tags. <br><br> -->

There may also be some other atypical ways-let me know your ideas.

<h4>other ideas</h4>

If you are an IPSD student try to do something with your domestic
internship that you started in Fall<br><br>
<!-- try to conatct camconnect and see if you can do any work for them -->
