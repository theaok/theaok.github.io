\section{Response to Editor} 


%TODO be more conversational here ! :)
\noindent Dear Professor Zhao,\\

\noindent Thank you for the opportunity to submit a revised draft. We have revised the manuscript in light of the reviewer's suggestions. We list below in inline format our brief responses to reviewer' comments and attach at the end tracked changes that show precisely the additions and deletions in the manuscript.

In light of the positive peer reviewer' recommendations we are hopeful that you will be able to make a positive decision.  We appreciate your consideration. Thank you.  
\\

%DO NOT SELF IDENTIFY IN THIS BLIND DOCUMENT

% Let me begin by thanking the anonymous reviewer for helpful
% suggestions. Below, I reply inline to your comments. The
% differences between last submission and this revison follow.



%\textbf{most of it is about flow, tone down, and writing in a more
%  standard/mainstream way--i tried to do a bunch especially following their
%  advice; but i think rubia is better at this kind of revision than me! where my
%writing typically and inherently suffers from lack of flow, grandoisity, and
%oddness :))}\\ LOL...=) I think it's flowing much better now, did some editing here and there, hopefully, they'll agree as well 


%\textbf{make sure ``clear and well tied together paragraphs''} DONE\\

%\textbf{also note that vast majority of the comments are about intro/lit; tiny
%  bit on discussion; and virtually none on empirical part: method/data/results}\\


%\textbf{im thinking that rev2 may be amin or thrift--comments just like amin and
%  thrift are more conceptual than empirical; both top top scholars} NICE! \\

%\textbf{in addtition to flow, cut repetition}; YEAP, WE HAD A FEW STILL IN THERE, IT'S MUCH MORE TO THE POINT NOW WITHOUT TOO MUCH REPETITION\\

%In general we cut a bit to streamline, and also avoid repetiion; we realize that
%this is an important editorial step as \textit{Cities} may be less polemical
%than some other journals.

\section{Response to Reviewer \#2} 

\cc{Reviewer \#2: Many thanks for your revisions. The literature review content and structure is much improved but I still find that the literature review has some very general, strong, and unnuanced trends being pointed at, with limited recent citations.}

Thank you for acknowledging our revisions. We have now revised the literature review and also the manuscript to ensure that our statements are nuanced. We have also included more recent citations to strengthen our arguments. 


\cc{Here are some examples below, but please carefully review your statements, citations, and generalizations that you draw:

This sentence is illustrative of the limitations I point at above: 

``Many people are drawn to metropolitan areas given the positive aspects of city life amenities, freedom, productivity, research and innovation, economic growth, wages, and multiple efficiencies related
to density in transportation, public goods provision,  and  lower per capita pollution (Tonnies, [1887] 2002; O'Sullivan,.'' These are grand, generalized statements that could be further nuanced.}

We have rephrased this sentence and have also added references to corroborate our claims. 

\cc{Similarly, that sentence ``that urban living has drastically improved many aspects of life (e.g., Glaeser, 2011):'' is only reflective of one citation, one from the main writer on the advantages of city life. There is no nuance or additional references for the statement. What does this statement mean: ``Moreover,cities are less polluted than they used to be, there is  more redevelopment(e.g., Glaeser, 2011): ,  and the younger generations are happier living in cities.''} 

We have added more references to strengthen our argument, and completely rephrased this paragraph. This helped with the flow and made arguments more clear and focused. 

\cc{Similarly this one is also left un-nuanced: ``urbanites tend to have larger social networks and socialize more frequently while
 having more opportunities to meet new friends or partners (Mouratidis, 2018, 2017).'' Some would say that cities are also more anonymous and trigger more superficial relations.}

We have rephrased the passage in question to make it more nuanced, but we are essentially quoting Mouratidis 2017, 2018. We acknowledge that cities are more anonymous and trigger more superficial relations, for example: 

'' Although city life is related to impersonal social relations, studies show that cities actually have higher levels of social interaction, participation in religious groups and volunteering than the suburbs.'' 
We also discuss in the paper how the anonymity of cities is what might draw misanthropes to live there. See for example pages 4 and 16.   


\cc{This sentence was also added without much elaboration and referencing. The authors should engage more in depth with that statement: ``Still, urbanization does not need to lead to extreme overcrowding, and attention should be paid to the many potential drivers
of crowding such as uneven urban development, gentrification and displacement, as well as inequality in large globalizing cities.'' }

We added references and some elaboration--our 
paper is about misanthropy, however,  and full elaboration of other aspects is beyond the
scope.

\section*{Response to Reviewer \#2} 
\cc{In recent years an interest has developed in comparing quality of life on both sides of the Atlantic. This paper gives a refreshingly crisp report on why are there such marked differences in satisfaction with working hours in the US and Europe, a topic that according to the author is underrepresented in the QOL literature. The author pits cultural against economic reasons to explain preferences for longer and shorter working hours. An excursion into the value attached to work in the two study contexts suggests an explanation (see Table 2 and Figure 3). A major strength is the care taken to harmonise relevant data collected on both sides of the Atlantic.}

\rr{n/a} N/A

\cc{Quibbles:\\
Tables and graphs in the text are kept to a minimum. The remainder of the evidence is placed in the
appendices. This seems to work well.}

\rr{n/a} N/A


\cc {However, readers might like to see the questions contained in Tables 8 and 9 repeated in the
  legends to Tables 9 - 16, and Tables 18-20.} 

\rr{10-19//}  To make the appendices more concise I decreased spacing in tables from
1.5 to 1.0. As a result, there are now on average 3 tables per page instead of 2, and it is easier to
find them. Also length of the
manuscript decreased from  26 to 22 pages, which  saves space in the journal. Repeating questions in
legends will take up space and not clarify much: frequency tables are fairly self-explanatory.

\cc{The alignment of several items in Table 8 is incorrect and the wording of the item on the showcard for 'GSS friends' is missing: say: 'How often do you see your friends?'}

\rr{13//}  I fixed the alignment in Table 8 in column 1. And added ``Spend a social evening with friends who live outside the neighborhood?''


\section*{Reviewer \#3}

\cc{ This paper intends to explain the difference between Europeans and Americans
on work and happiness. It finds that Europeans work to live and Americans live to work. This is
indeed a cultural explanation which deserves attention of the academic field in the study of
subjective wellbeing.}

\rr{n/a} N/A

\cc{ In my view, the litmus test of this paper for acceptance of publication is
whether it uses the same measure of subjective wellbeing; as life satisfaction and happiness are
different, despite both are subjective wellbeing. The paper recognizes this difference and clearly
illustrates it in footnote no. 3, but it makes it clear that they are used interchangeably. This is
fine if two concepts are the same; however, when we go to the measurement -the Europeans were asked
about the extent of satisfaction "with the life you (respondents) lead"; so, this is a life
satisfaction measure. To the Americans, the question they were asked is the extent of happiness of
"things are these days";
so, this is a happiness measure. Therefore, the Europeans were asked about a cognitive judgment of
their life; a long period of time up to the moment they were interviewed. But Americans were asked
differently - "things are these days" indicates a shorter span of time and the idea is only about an
affective mood - happiness, without any cognitive evaluation as in the case of life satisfaction. In
other words, both concepts should not be treated as the same on the operational level in this
paper.}

\rr{5/2/6} This wording difference was acknowledged in the paper:

\begin{quote}
 Wording of the
survey questions is slightly
different (see  Appendix B), but these small
differences do not make surveys
incomparable. At least one other paper used the same surveys
to conduct successful comparisons
between Europe and the US (see \citet{alesina03}). 
\end{quote}

\noindent\citet[2013/2/11]{alesina03} defended this approach arguing that:
\begin{quote}
 ``happiness'' and ``life satisfaction'' are
highly correlated. 
\end{quote}


\noindent I reviewed recent literature and found another published paper  using the same survey items. \citet[211/2/20]{stevenson09w} defend this approach arguing that:  
\begin{quote}
While life satisfaction and happiness are somewhat different
concepts, responses are highly correlated.
\end{quote}

\noindent \citet{alesina03} \citet{stevenson09w} are able to make statements about correlations and compare
happiness with life satisfaction because there was happiness question in addition to life
satisfaction question in Eurobarometer until 1986
(still, they use life satisfaction measure because it is available for more years).
I use Eurobarometers in 1998 and 2001 (these are the only datasets with working hours available
for Europe) and I have to use ``life satisfaction'' measure. Both, \citet{alesina03} and
\citet{stevenson09w} use \underline{exactly the same survey items as this paper uses} to compare
happiness in the U.S. and Europe.

\rr{5/2/6} I have changed text FROM:

\begin{quote}
 Wording of the
survey questions is slightly
different (see  Appendix B), but these small
differences do not make surveys
incomparable. At least one other paper used the same surveys
to conduct successful comparisons
between Europe and the US (see \citet{alesina03}). 
\end{quote}

\noindent TO:

\begin{quote}
Wording of the
survey questions is slightly
different (see  Appendix B), but these small
differences do not make surveys
incomparable. At least two other papers used the same surveys
to conduct successful comparisons
between Europe and the US (see \citet{alesina03, stevenson09w}). ``Happiness'' and ``Life
Satisfaction'' measures are highly correlated. 
\end{quote}

\noindent Still, using different measures may be a limitation of this study, and this pertains to
independent variables as well. This limitation is acknowledged by adding  
footnote 5 on p. 5.

\begin{quote}
 Still, robustness of the results can be improved if wording of the survey
 questions is the same for all respondents. This remains for the future research when better data
 become available.
\end{quote}


\cc{Of course, a composite index combining both happiness and life satisfaction is a solution;
but unfortunately, this paper does not have it for this comparative study on subjective wellbeing
between Europeans and Americans. On the basis of this assessment, I do not recommend to accept the
paper for publication in its present form.}

\rr{n/a} If I understand this comment correctly, reviewer asks to combine happiness for the
U.S. with life satisfaction for Europe, but I believe this to be a misunderstanding: In order to
combine two different  measures into an index they need to be observed for the same
 individuals. This is not the case here: there is happiness for Americans and life satisfaction for Europeans.

\noindent The only way to create an index is to find both happiness and life satisfaction measures in the same
dataset, but they do not
exist. Again, this is not a serious limitation because happiness and life satisfaction
are highly correlated and the very same measures as used in this paper are successfully used in the
literature  \citep{alesina03, stevenson09w}.
