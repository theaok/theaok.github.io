The manuscript focuses on a very interesting study topic, and it is framed adequately. However, the proposal needs considerable improvements:

1.- The structure and the format: excessive extension and the number of tables, introduction?, ":" instead of "." . Mention Table 2 before in the text. Merge Tables 1 and 2 in only one and reduce their size. What do you mean by "largest places"?. Table page 7, table 3, reduce and remove tables not mentioned in the text.

2.- What about the theoretical framework about rural areas, in addition to the repulse of urban cities?. The rural idyl, the rural reinassance: Michael Woods, Cloke, Kayser, ... .

3.- Explain in an extended way the source used.  

4.- The "Results" paragraph is extremely unclear and short, with tables occupying all this part. 

5.- What measures indicate a positive relationship between urbanity and materialism?
