<h3>course description</h3> <!-- FIXME this may need a rewrite -->

This course introduces economic development at local level. We will
briefly cover basic development theory, and focus  on practical
issues such as planning and analyzing. <br><br>
We will try to make it a discussion-based seminar; not a lecture! So I
expect you to be prepared and talk a lot!

<h3>student learning objectives/outcomes</h3>
([*]  bonus/not required)
<dl>
<li> become familiar with basic development theories
<li> learn planning for local development
<li> learn strategies for local development
<li> [*] review literature
<li> learn how to find the local data  and  produce descriptive statistics at different levels of  aggregation and make basic inferences
<li> demonstrate mastery of the material by writing a paper, which you
  should submit to a journal  
</dl>

<h3>books</h3>
<br>
<br>
NOTE: i have put Blakely and Green on the reserve at the library <br>
NOTE: you do not have to buy any books; i am trying to summarize key points in slides, and
  only material covered in lectures and posted on the syllabus is required,
but your understanding will be deeper if you read the books...You can
largely pick, but you have to read quite a bit for this class
NOTE: Blakely, O'Sullivan and Green et al are typical classroom textbooks, and hence, comprehensive
but dry; Others books are topic specific, and more story-like...We
will go over them in first class you should get at least one!   
<!-- LATER: like data they should be kept in bibtex and pulled by tag -->

    Economic Development: Theory and Practice <a href="http://amzn.com/1412960932">http://amzn.com/1412960932</a><br>
    
    It is a book for practitioners/planners at county, city and
    neighborhood level. We will mostly follow its chapters in slides.

  This book focuses  on community, social capital, and hence the "soft" side
  of the development.

<!-- <li> R and Python are free -->
<!-- <li> all software is cross-platform: linux, mac, windows -->
<!-- </dl> -->

<h3>requirements</h3>

<dl>
<li> midterm exam - you will write a short essay and try to solve few
  problems based on the class materials and assigned readings
<li> problem sets. You may work in groups on problem
  sets, but write up answers separately <!-- , but nover works in paractice and they like work all together anyway<u> indicate who you worked with</u>, -->
  and the more people in the group the better/longer the product should be. 
<li> [publishable!] paper -  max <b>10</b> double spaced pages covering at least one of the
  topics covered. It may be an empirical paper, literature review or a
  strategy/plan for local development. If you submit an early  draft, I will give you comments. 
  You may cowrite one paper <b>(upto 2 people)</b> but then the paper
  quality needs to higher than a single-authored paper. 
  Ideally, the paper should be submitted to a professional journal for a
  publication.<br><br>
  Your paper should read like a story (be engaging, have some point)
  and your conclusions should be 'robust', i.e. exclude alternative explanations
<li> presentation - a week or two weeks before the paper is due, you
  will present it to the class. Presentation will be 10-15 min and you
  should expect questions from the audience. Note: some ps will also
  involve a presentation.
</dl>

<h3>attendance</h3>
 Attendance is  optional, but  you are
responsible for everything covered in the class, whether or not it was
 listed in the syllabus. You are also responsible for any announcements made in class.  If you  miss a
class, be sure to consult with a fellow student to learn what transpired.

<!-- TODO this should be in gereic -->
<!-- core values are per naspaa  -->
<h3>core values, plagiarism and cheating</h3>

Ethics--at the international, national and local levels<br>
Justice--economic, social and equality <br>
Diversity<br>
Transparency <br><br>

Everything that you submit in this class (problem sets, presentation,
paper) is assumed to be your original idea; if it is not yours, you
need to cite the source. If you do not cite the source, it is
plagiarism and I will penalize it with F grade. Likewise, any
communication with anybody else during the exam  or use of
unauthorized devices (e.g. phones, notebooks) will be penalized with
F grade. In addition, any violation may result in disciplinary
action. <br>

To be safe, ask questions when in doubt and be explicit:
e.g. using text that you wrote for other classes in this class is
plagiarism (yes, you can plagiarize yourself); but on the other
hand you want to built on your previous work. To be safe, just mention
somewhere (e.g. footnote, appendix, etc) that, say, the introduction
section was written for another class and build on your previous work.

<hr />
(tentative: the most uptodate calendar is always on my website)
<dl> <u>very important notes</u> 
  <li>for weekly book readings see slides <u>from that class (so to
  see what you need to read for next week see next week's slides):</u>  "outline" on p. 2 <!-- FIXME do it for every file -->
  <li>there will be additional paper readings listed starting on p.3;<br>
  if any reading is required, it will say at the top of page 3: 
  "NECESSARY READING: reading_names..." e.g. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/adamokuliczkozaryn/urb_eco/hard_economic_development_theory.pdf">hard_economic_development_theory.pdf</a>
  <li>when printing handouts you can print multiple slides per sheet ((i
  like 6)<a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/332/332720.html#main_Print multiple">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/332/332720.html#main_Print multiple</a>
  <li> some slides are lengthy and will continue over more than one
  class--we will go as fast as we can, but also allow time for discussion
