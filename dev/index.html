<h3>course description</h3> <!-- FIXME this may need a rewrite -->

This course introduces economic (and other) development at local level. We will
briefly cover basic development theory, and focus  on practical
issues such as planning and analyzing. <br><br>
We will try to make it a discussion-based seminar; not a lecture! So I
expect you to be prepared and talk a lot!

<h3>student learning objectives/outcomes</h3>
<dl>
<li> become familiar with basic development theories
<li> learn planning for local development
<li> learn strategies for local development
<li> review literature
<li> learn how to find the local data  and  produce descriptive statistics at different levels of  aggregation and make basic inferences
<li> demonstrate mastery of the material by writing a paper, which you
  should submit to a journal  
</dl>

<h3>books</h3>
<br>
<br>
NOTE: i have put Blakely and Green on the reserve at the library <br>
NOTE: you do not have to buy any books; i am trying to summarize key points in slides, and
  only material covered in lectures and posted on the syllabus is required,
but your understanding will be deeper if you read the books...You can
largely pick, but you have to read quite a bit for this class
NOTE: Blakely, O'Sullivan and Green et al are typical classroom textbooks, and hence, comprehensive
but dry; Other books are topic specific, and more story-like...We
will go over them in first class you should get at least one!   
<!-- LATER: like data they should be kept in bibtex and pulled by tag -->

    Economic Development: Theory and Practice <a href="http://amzn.com/1412960932">http://amzn.com/1412960932</a><br>
    
    It is a book for practitioners/planners at county, city and
    neighborhood level. We will mostly follow its chapters in slides.

  of the development.

<h3>requirements</h3>

<dl>
<li> midterm exam - you will write a short essay and try to solve few
  problems based on the class materials and assigned readings
<li> problem sets - you may work in groups on problem
  sets, but write up answers separately <!-- , but nover works in paractice and they like work all together anyway<u> indicate who you worked with</u>, -->
  and the more people in the group the better/longer the product should be. 
<li> [publishable!] paper -  max <b>10</b> single spaced pages (if you
  need more see me) covering at least one of the
  topics covered. It may be an empirical paper, literature review or a
  strategy/plan for local development. If you submit an early  draft, I will give you comments. 
  You may cowrite one paper <b>(upto 2 people)</b> but then the paper
  quality needs to higher than a single-authored paper. 
  Ideally, the paper should be submitted to a professional journal for a
  publication.<br><br>
  Your paper should read like a story (be engaging, have some point)
  and your conclusions should be 'robust', i.e. exclude alternative explanations
<li> presentation - a week or two weeks before the paper is due, you
  will present it to the class. Presentation will be 10-15 min and you
  should expect questions from the audience. Note: some ps will also
  involve a presentation.

<h4>rules</h4>

<u>do not share or link to class videos!</u>
These videocasts and podcasts are the exclusive copyrighted property of Rutgers University and the Professor teaching the course. Rutgers University and the Professor grant you a license only to replay them for your own personal use during the course. Sharing them with others (including other students), reproducing, distributing, or posting any part of them elsewhere -- including but not limited to any internet site -- will be treated as a copyright violation and an offense against the honesty provisions of the Code of Student Conduct. Furthermore, for Law Students, this will be reported by the Law School to the licensing authorities in any jurisdiction in which you may apply to the bar.


<u>attendance</u>
 Attendance is  recommended. But  you are
responsible for everything covered in the class, whether or not it was
 listed in the syllabus. You are also responsible for any announcements made in class.  If you  miss a
class, be sure to consult with a fellow student to learn what
 transpired. Also class discussion is a part of the final grade, so
 you'll miss points if absent.<br><br>


<u>incompletes:</u> Generally speaking, the material in this course is best learned as a single unit. I
will grant incompletes only in cases where a substantial change in life circumstances occurs that
is beyond the control of the student, and only with appropriate
documentation.<br><br> 

<u>study groups.</u> You are encouraged to form a regular study group. Many students over the years
have found the study groups to be very helpful. Study groups are permitted and encouraged to
work on the problem sets together. However, each individual student should write up his or her
own answer to hand in, based on his or her own understanding of the material. Do not hand in a
copy of another person’s problem set, even a member of your own group. Writing up your own
answer helps you to internalize the group discussions and is a crucial step in the learning process.<br><br>

<!-- say who you worked with or say worked alone ! -->

<u>Academic Integrity.</u> I am very serious about this. Make no
mistake--I may appear accommodating and  informal--but I am extremely
strict about academic integrity.   Violations of academic integrity include cheating on tests or handing in
assignments that do not reflect your own work and/or the work of a study group in which you
actively participated. Handing in your own work that was performed not
for this class (e.g. other class, any other project) is cheating,
too. I have a policy of zero tolerance for cheating. Violations will be referred
to the appropriate university authorities. <br><br>
For more information see <a href="http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy/">http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy</a><br><br>

Everything that you submit in this class (problem sets, presentation,
paper) is assumed to be your original idea; if it is not yours, you
need to cite the source. If you do not cite the source, it is
plagiarism and I will penalize it with F grade. Likewise, any
communication with anybody else during the exam  or use of
unauthorized devices (e.g. phones, notebooks) will be penalized with
F grade. In addition, any violation may result in disciplinary
action. <br>

To be safe, ask questions when in doubt and be explicit:
e.g. using text that you wrote for other classes in this class is
plagiarism (yes, you can plagiarize yourself); but on the other
hand you want to built on your previous work. To be safe, just mention
somewhere (e.g. footnote, appendix, etc) that, say, the introduction
section was written for another class and build on your previous work.<br>


<u>Accommodating Students with Disabilities.</u>

Any student with a disability affecting performance in the class
should contact the disability office ASAP: <a href="http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html">http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html</a>
