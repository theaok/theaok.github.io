<h4>course description</h4>

Happiness, in addition to or even as opposed to income, is being
recognized as an end goal and key measure of development. Happiness,
or to use a more scholarly term,  Subjective Wellbeing (SWB) is increasingly being studied across social science fields--this class focuses on geographic dimension of it: 
 community, location, and urbanicity.
 Much of the class will be devoted to urban subjective wellbeing. 

Happiness can also be used to
address social problems--it provides a measure (a yardstick) of how
social problems affect human flourishing. 
 Two key and related social problems will
be considered: poverty and inequality. Two related remedies will be considered
as well: redistribution and welfare. Another social problem to be
considered is consumerism / conspicuous consumption.

The class is mostly about theory, classic and key findings, but a substantial
part of the course will be devoted to data and quantitative findings. 
<!--  students will be able to -->
<!-- pick their focus: either theoretical or quantitative explorations. -->
<!--  The class will start with a -->
<!-- rigorous theoretical foundation and then will transition into -->
<!-- data-driven social science inquiry into  -->
<!-- determinants of subjective wellbeing.  -->
 The main outcome is
self-reported, subjective assessment of one's life satisfaction, but other
related outcomes will be considered as well, for instance, some
objective social indicators, such as urban quality of life. Therefore,
the class is little broader than just SWB, and fits under umbrella of
social indicators research. 
 To some degree, the class will be customized to student
interests. The key product of the class is publishable paper. 


<h4>learning objectives/outcomes</h4>

<dl>
<li> learn the theory of subjective wellbeing (SWB) field
<li> become familiar with social indicators field
<li> become familiar with wealth of data available in the field
<li> analyze the data
<li> write a publishable paper
<li> become happier (really!)

<h4>required textbooks <!-- and materials --></h4>

<!-- There are no required textbooks.  -->

<dl>

  second edition
</dl>

<!-- <h4>recommended course materials</h4> -->

<!-- They will be posted throught the class.  -->

<!-- A student must pick at least one of the following texts, based on her -->
<!-- interest, and master it. SWB is cross-disciplinary, and so it can be -->
<!-- approached from several angles. -->


<h4>requirements</h4>

<dl>
<li> There are 5 problem sets (ps) due the following week after being
  posted (unless indicated otherwise; some ps will be due in 2 weeks). You may
  work in groups (<b><=2</b>), but <u> indicate who you worked with</u>,
  and the more people in the group, the better the ps must be. The
  group must submit only one ps. All ps are stepping stones to the final paper: outline, drafts, presentation(s). 
<li> You will write a paper: either theory, literature review, or
  empirical investigation. A typical paper will be 5 to 25
  double spaced pages. Important!: To receive full credit, your paper
  must be "publishable" and  submitted to a peer-reviewed journal at
  the end of the course. Publish or perish!
</dl>

<h4>grading</h4>

<dl>
<li> problem sets 50% (5ps x 10%) <!-- TODO have 7 next year and make final -->
  <!-- project 30perc -->
<li> paper 50%

         <!-- \item  first classes cover basics to make sure -->
         <!--   everybody is on the same page, again no prerequisites for -->
         <!--   this class -->
         <!-- \item then we will be intermingling more advanced topics with actual data management examples -->

         <!--   may be steep--use additional materials to catch up -->

         <!-- \item there is lots of material and the idea is not memorize, but to -->

         <!-- \item often we will be splitting topics by level: eg  class -->

<h4>rules</h4>

<u>do not share or link to class videos!</u>
These videocasts and podcasts are the exclusive copyrighted property of Rutgers University and the Professor teaching the course. Rutgers University and the Professor grant you a license only to replay them for your own personal use during the course. Sharing them with others (including other students), reproducing, distributing, or posting any part of them elsewhere -- including but not limited to any internet site -- will be treated as a copyright violation and an offense against the honesty provisions of the Code of Student Conduct. Furthermore, for Law Students, this will be reported by the Law School to the licensing authorities in any jurisdiction in which you may apply to the bar.

<u>attendance</u>
 Attendance is  recommended.  Be advised that you are
responsible for any material covered in the class, whether or not it was in the readings or
lecture notes. You are also responsible for any announcements made in class. For most
students, attendance is simply essential to learning the material. If you do need to miss a
class, be sure to consult with a fellow student to learn what transpired.<br><br> 

<u>incompletes:</u> Generally speaking, the material in this course is best learned as a single unit. I
will grant incompletes only in cases where a substantial change in life circumstances occurs that
is beyond the control of the student, and only with appropriate
documentation.<br><br> 

<u>study groups.</u> You are encouraged to form a regular study group. Many students over the years
have found the study groups to be very helpful. Study groups are permitted and encouraged to
work on the problem sets together. However, each individual student should write up his or her
own answer to hand in, based on his or her own understanding of the material. Do not hand in a
copy of another person’s problem set, even a member of your own group. Writing up your own
answer helps you to internalize the group discussions and is a crucial step in the learning process.<br><br>

<!-- say who you worked with or say worked alone ! -->

<u>Academic Integrity.</u> I am very serious about this. Make no
mistake--I may appear accommodating and  informal--but I am extremely
strict about academic integrity.   Violations of academic integrity include cheating on tests or handing in
assignments that do not reflect your own work and/or the work of a study group in which you
actively participated. Handing in your own work that was performed not
for this class (e.g. other class, any other project) is cheating,
too. I have a policy of zero tolerance for cheating. Violations will be referred
to the appropriate university authorities. <br><br>

<u>Accommodating Students with Disabilities.</u>

Any student with a disability affecting performance in the class
should contact the disability office ASAP: <a href="http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html">http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html</a>
