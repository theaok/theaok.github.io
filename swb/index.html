<h3>prerequisites: none</h3>

<!-- You need to be comfortable using a computer. Knowledge of Stata and data-management/computer science is helpful but not -->
<!-- necessary. We will cover the basics.  -->

<h3>course description</h3>

The main goal is for you to produce research on happiness (or other social
indicator such as freedom or trust). You will write a
journal paper, and possibly start your dissertation in this class.<br><br>

Happiness, in addition to or even as opposed to income, is becoming
 end goal and a key measure of development. Happiness, or scholarly
 Subjective Wellbeing (SWB) is  studied across social sciences--this
 class focuses on data and geography. Much of the class is  urban-rural and regional, and my
 current focus: Colombia/Latin America. <br><br> 

SWB can be used to
address social problems--SWB is a measure (yardstick) of how
social problems affect human flourishing.  
 <!-- Two key and related social problems are poverty and inequality. Two -->
 <!-- remedies will be considered as well: redistribution and welfare. -->
 Some key social problems are: poverty, inequality, and  consumerism / conspicuous consumption.<br><br>

The class material is: theory, classic and key findings, and data and
quantitative findings. Your task will be to make use some of that
material in your own paper, write your own literature review, and in
most cases analyze data.
<!--  students will be able to -->
<!-- pick their focus: either theoretical or quantitative explorations. -->
<!--  The class will start with a -->
<!-- rigorous theoretical foundation and then will transition into -->
<!-- data-driven social science inquiry into  -->
<!-- determinants of subjective wellbeing.  -->

<!--  The main outcome is -->
<!-- self-reported, subjective assessment of one's life satisfaction (SWB), but other -->
<!-- related outcomes will be considered as well, for instance, some -->
<!-- objective social indicators, such as urban quality of life. Therefore, -->
<!-- the class is little broader than just SWB, and fits under umbrella of -->
<!-- social indicators research. Eg, a great soc ind to study is trust/social capital. --><br><br>

Social indicators field is extremely broad and
 fits multitude of research across all social science:
in this class you'll be able to use happiness (or other social
indicators such as freedom or trust) to explore your existing research
 interests (eg housing, education, religion).
<br><br>

I will customize a bit to your interests. The goal is ambitious: to produce publishable paper
<b>[Don't worry if you are not quant! I can help you or indeed do the quant part for you if you  do other parts].</b> Realistically, won't be able to send it to a journal by the end of the class, but I volunteer my time after the semester ends (ideally
  should wrap it up within the following semster). The
  requirement for an A is to have it almost publishable this semester.

 <br><br>
<!-- Again, publish or perish! In this class we will write a publishable -->
<!-- paper (you won't get an A unless your paper is good enough to be -->
<!-- submitted to a decent journal (<b>SIR, ARIQ, JOHS</b>). -->

<h4>Campbell</h4>

  A free dataset accompanying
  the book:  can calculate and study everything from the book
  yourself AND use these data for you final project! <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/3508">https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/3508</a>

<h4> GSS <a href="http://gss.norc.org/">http://gss.norc.org/</a></h4>

The website has full annual files and best is cumulative 1972-2020.  <!-- in Jupyter: /mnt/data/gss/GSS7216_R4.DTA -->
I cleaned it up and just retained a bunch of key vars <!-- in Jupyter: /mnt/data/gss/gss.dta -->
 <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aFuG5Mmci8NxGFtJ1zJQZ0NGh7uA-rqa/view?usp=sharing"></a>
To find variables, just ctrl-f in cumulative codebook from GSS website
 for a string you are interested in, say for happiness/life satisfaction do "happ" to
pick up both "happiness" and "happy" and for satisfaction "satis" to
pick up "satisfied" and "satisfaction." Or in stata "lookfor," eg
 "lookfor inc" to find income variables.<br><br>

<h4>WVS <a href="https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org">https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org</a></h4>

Covers about 80 counties, 7 waves of data for many countries going back to
80s, a wonderful dataset to explore happiness internationally, and as
the name idicated the data is about values across the world. The above
website includes the data and codebooks, and again, probably most of
time want a cumulative dataset

<!-- <h3>recommended course materials</h3> -->

<!-- They will be posted throught the class.  -->

<!-- A student must pick at least one of the following texts, based on her -->
<!-- interest, and master it. SWB is cross-disciplinary, and so it can be -->
<!-- approached from several angles. -->


<h3>requirements/advice</h3>

<b>2 keys to success: start early AND ask often many questions</b> 

<dl>
<li> There are 5 problem sets (ps) <!-- due the following week after being -->
  <!-- posted (unless indicated otherwise) -->. You may
  work in groups (<b><=2</b>), but <u> indicate who you worked with</u>,
  and the more people in the group, the better the ps must be. The
  group must submit only one ps (of course can and should also work
  together informally and share ideas and collaborate and submit
  separate ps). All ps are stepping stones to the final paper: outline, drafts, presentation(s). 
<li> You will write a paper: typically empirical, but can also be
  theory or literature review. A typical paper will be 5 to 25
  double spaced pages. Important!: To receive full credit, your paper
  must be "publishable" and  "ready" to be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal at
  the end of the course. Publish or perish!
</dl>

<h3>grading</h3>

<h2>rules</h2>

<u>do not share or link to class videos!</u>
These videocasts and podcasts are the exclusive copyrighted property of Rutgers University and the Professor teaching the course. Rutgers University and the Professor grant you a license only to replay them for your own personal use during the course. Sharing them with others (including other students), reproducing, distributing, or posting any part of them elsewhere -- including but not limited to any internet site -- will be treated as a copyright violation and an offense against the honesty provisions of the Code of Student Conduct. Furthermore, for Law Students, this will be reported by the Law School to the licensing authorities in any jurisdiction in which you may apply to the bar.<br><br>

<u>attendance</u>
 Attendance is  recommended.  Be advised that you are
responsible for any material covered in the class, whether or not it was in the readings or
lecture notes. You are also responsible for any announcements made in class. For most
students, attendance is simply essential to learning the material. If you do need to miss a
class, be sure to consult with a fellow student to learn what transpired.<br><br> 

<u>incompletes:</u> Generally speaking, the material in this course is best learned as a single unit. I
will grant incompletes only in cases where a substantial change in life circumstances occurs that
is beyond the control of the student, and only with appropriate
documentation.<br><br> 

<u>study groups.</u> You are encouraged to form a regular study group. Many students over the years
have found the study groups to be very helpful. Study groups are permitted and encouraged to
work on the problem sets together. However, each individual student should write up his or her
own answer to hand in, based on his or her own understanding of the material. Do not hand in a
copy of another person’s problem set, even a member of your own group. Writing up your own
answer helps you to internalize the group discussions and is a crucial step in the learning process.<br><br>

<!-- say who you worked with or say worked alone ! -->

<u>Academic Integrity.</u> I am very serious about this. Make no
mistake--I may appear accommodating and  informal--but I am extremely
strict about academic integrity.   Violations of academic integrity include cheating on tests or handing in
assignments that do not reflect your own work and/or the work of a study group in which you
actively participated. Handing in your own work that was performed not
for this class (e.g. other class, any other project) is cheating,
too. I have a policy of zero tolerance for cheating. Violations will be referred
to the appropriate university authorities. <br><br>
For more information see <a href="http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy/">http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy</a><br><br>

<u>Accommodating Students with Disabilities.</u>

Any student with a disability affecting performance in the class
should contact the disability office ASAP: <a href="https://success.camden.rutgers.edu/success-services/disability-services/">https://success.camden.rutgers.edu/success-services/disability-services/</a>
