<h4>prerequisites</h4>

You need to be comfortable using a computer. Knowledge of Stata and data-management/computer science is helpful but not
necessary. We will cover the basics. 

<h4>note to MPA and other master's students</h4>

Don't want to scare you but the bar is high and it is research
oriented programming class meant for researchers (PhDs) and some
advanced research oriented masters students (non-Phds grading bar lower). You will need to set
aside plenty of time for this class, definitely more than 10hrs per
week outside of classroom.  

<h4>course description</h4>

Recently, there is more focus on (and even more need for)
computer science in social science. Reverse is true to some degree,
too: computer scientists are doing social science these days, e.g. <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.8578.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.8578.pdf</a>
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the main focus in Social Science is still on theory and data analysis, while data management is
overlooked. Yet, data management is not only a fundamental part of social science research but also
the part that takes most of the time. This class aims at filling this gap. It is an applied class with
hands-on approach. You will see many exercises and tutorials.<br><br> 

This is applied research class that aims to teach computer tools for social science research that
can automate the process and increase the academic productivity. Most
of this class is writing computers programs; if you do not like
programming, this class is not for you... But you may not yet know
whether you like it and you may start liking it in this class: it
often happened before!
<br><br>
There are two major components to the class: (1) data management, (2) simple programming.
We will use Stata only. I'd also recommend Python. I'd discourage R for data management (unless small simple datasets and you already use R). 
<br><br>
The class teaches tools for data
cleaning, organization, quality control, and automation. Topics
include data types, text/math functions, labeling, recoding,
documentation, merging, reshaping, and programming  (macros, loops,
and branching).  
<br><br>
This class should be named "programming Stata for social
science" or "intro to data science for social science using Stata"
<br><br>
Stata is an excellent software for data
management. But sometimes you need to use a general purpose
programming language for data management. Python is both powerful and
easy to use. We will use it for files manipulation, text processing, and interacting with APIs and scraping websites. [Python is optional]
<br><br>



<h4>learning objectives/outcomes</h4>

The key is the mastery of "data story-telling:" 1) What data are
telling, 2) what I want to say, and 3) what audience needs to know<br><br>

You'll learn:
<dl>
<li> about data (sources, best practices, tips and tricks): this class
  is as much about stata as about data (you'll use the data you chose
  that will serve you well beyond this class!!) 
<li> the basics of the computer programming
<li> the practice of data management (there will be some theory, too)
<li> how to conduct reproducible research 
<li> how to automate research by programming
<li> basics of Python for data management [optional]
<li> GIT, a version control system 
</dl>

You'll demonstrate mastery of the material by writing code for a
project/paper using learned  techniques;
you may cowrite code (<b>upto 2 people</b>) but then
the project should be <b>2</b> times better than a single-authored paper

<h4>required textbooks and materials</h4>

No required textbooks. All required materials (code, readings) will be provided. 

<h4>recommended course materials</h4>

<dl>
<li> Most of the class is based on: <u>Mitchell</u>
'' Data Management Using Stata: A
  Practical Handbook'' <a href="http://www.Stata.com/bookstore/dmus.html">http://www.Stata.com/bookstore/dmus.html</a>(nice)

<li> A similar book, but with focus on organization is: <u>Long</u>
'' The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata'' <a href="http://www.Stata.com/bookstore/wdaus.html">http://www.Stata.com/bookstore/wdaus.html</a>(much boilerplate, outdated)
<li>Programming, specifically,  is covered in Chris Baum "An
  Introduction to Stata
  Programming" <a href="https://www.stata.com/bookstore/introduction-stata-programming/">https://www.stata.com/bookstore/introduction-stata-programming/</a>(detailed))

<li> For beginners:
'' A Gentle Introduction to Stata, 3rd Edition''
 <a href="https://www.stata.com/bookstore/gentle-introduction-to-stata/">https://www.stata.com/bookstore/gentle-introduction-to-stata/</a>

<li> Also for beginners: "Statistics with STATA: Version 12" by L
  Hamilton <a href="https://www.stata.com/bookstore/statistics-with-stata/">https://www.stata.com/bookstore/statistics-with-stata/</a>(good but overpriced)
 <li> But no need to buy books;  many superb free online stuff:<br>

<li> may see on your right 'New repository' button: click it; or on
  the left  go to 'repositories', click 'new'; then pick some name for
  your repository, keep
  selected 'public', important!: must check 'Initialize this repository
  with a README', and click button 'Create repository'
<!-- <li> then click blue 'README' about in the middle and third of a page -->
<!--   from the top, can write something there, say brief description of -->
<!--   what you're gonna be doing, then hit 'Commit new file'  -->
<li> now can simply hit button 'Upload files' and choose your dofile,
 say ps0.do, important: add some meaningful commit message, say: 'first try on importing and exporting data' and hit 'Commit

<li> then hit 'Settings' towards the top-right, and then on the left select
  'Collaborators' tab and add me "theaok" and hit 'Add collaborator',thats it!

<li> I will download it, edit, and upload back
<li> you can click my commit message and see the so called
  diff--the difference between your version and my version
<li>  you can <!-- either start another dofile from scratch on -->
  <!-- github.com or you can keep on working with this one--if so then -->
  download this latest version first, edit it, and upload it back when
  done--dont forget about a meaningful commit message--can keep on
  uploading newer versions as many times as you like 
<li> note: when you click the file, you can then click 'History' and
  see how the file evolved over time :)
<li> a thought about file naming: ps0.do, ps1.do, etc or just
  substantive name and keep it updating with new stuff as we go! say "incomeInequalityAcrossCounties.do"

<h4>recommended software</h4>

<h5>Python</h5>
<dl>
<li> there will be at least 2 classes in the second part of the
  semester about Python
<li> Python is a general purpose programming language that can do much
  more than stata (statistical software)
<li> Python is the most user friendly and easy to use general
  programming language
<li> Stata 16 or 17 can embed Python
</dl>


<h4>advice/requirements</h4>

<dl>
<li> <!-- Strictly speaking an advice, rather than a requirement, but in -->
  <!-- practice really a requirement, as it is virtually impossible to -->
  <!-- succeed otherwise! --> <b>2 keys to success: start early AND ask often many questions</b> This is a
  software class. It is different from all other classes! You will get
  stuck often and whenever  stuck, email me, as opposed to pulling
  your hair out! And stop by my office, too.
<li> There are 6  problem sets (ps) due the following week after being
  posted (unless indicated otherwise; some ps will be due in 2 weeks). You will be asked to write some computer code that
  does something that we covered in the class to your data. You may
  work in groups (<b><=2</b>), but <u>say who you worked with</u>,
  and the more people in the group, the better/longer the code should be.
<li> Final project is like final paper (doing some useful empirical
  quantitative research), except that I only grade code, in fact you can submit
  code only. 			       
<!-- <li> You're encouraged to write an empirical paper/report/etc on any topic<\!--  using one or more of the -\-> -->
<!--   <\!-- techniques covered in this course. A typical paper will be 5 to 20 -\-> -->
<!--   <\!-- double spaced pages -\->. I can give you comments and help with the -->
<!--   paper, and it is a good opportunity to produce a paper. But I will -->
<!--   grade only the code that you wrote to produce the results in your paper. -->
<!-- You will submit not only paper, but also code that produced results in -->
<!--   the paper; in fact, you can just submit the code.   -->
<!--  Ideally, the paper should be submitted to a professional journal for a publication. -->
</dl>

<h4>grading</h4>

<dl>
<li> problem sets 60% (6ps x 10%) [just computer code (dofile)] <!-- TODO have 7 next year and make final -->
  <!-- project 30perc -->
<li> final project  [just another computer code dofile wrapping previous ps] <!-- (code only; incl presentation (code and some output esp graphs<b>2*5%</b>)) -->  40%

NOTE: 2 classes on this important topic of visualization

Graphics is critical in understanding data, and understanding data is critical in data management.<br><br> <!-- Graphics is undervalued. It can be used to visualize data and data analysis outcomes. Humans can see patterns faster with graphics than with numbers. Especially for presentations use graphics !<br> -->

Results from stata are data too, and need to manage them too!

<!-- A decent text editor is an important tool for data analyst. You can use it to write/edit your statistical code (Do NOT write/edit code in MS Word !), but also to look at your data if data are in text format (e.g. .dat .txt .csv .tab . raw ). Statistical software usually comes with text editor. For instance, Stata has a built-in do-file editor. But these built-in text editors are poor as compared to stand-alone text editors. Using stand-alone text editor is more efficient: -->
<!-- You can define your own syntax highlighting (or use predefined) -->
<!-- You can manipulate your code using regular expressions -->
<!-- You can use many advanced features such as autocompletion, multi-view, bookmarks, macros, etc. -->
<!-- There are many text-editors out there. If you use windows, you have Notepad preinstalled, but Notepad is a really poor software like most Microsoft products. There is a good review of text editors for Stata (it is also useful if you use other software): http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html -->
<!-- I experimented with many text editors. If you use Windows, a good choice is Notepad++: http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm. -->
<!-- If you use Stata, you can actually run it from within Notepad++: -->
<!-- http://web.mit.edu/randallL/www/STATA.html and/or http://econweb.umd.edu/~kranker/code/notepad_to_stata.php -->

<!-- If you want really advanced (with really big learning curve) text editor, a good choice is Emacs: -->
<!-- http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs. You should also then get Emacs Speaks Statistics: -->
<!-- http://ess.r-project.org/ Another powerful text editor is Vim. -->

<!-- Spending time on learning text editor is a well-invested time. If you use windows, a really good -->
<!-- choice is notepad++  -->

<!-- You will see below that integrating npp with other software takes a little hacking around... -->

<h4>rules</h4>

<u>do not share or link to class videos!</u>
These videocasts and podcasts are the exclusive copyrighted property of Rutgers University and the Professor teaching the course. Rutgers University and the Professor grant you a license only to replay them for your own personal use during the course. Sharing them with others (including other students), reproducing, distributing, or posting any part of them elsewhere -- including but not limited to any internet site -- will be treated as a copyright violation and an offense against the honesty provisions of the Code of Student Conduct. Furthermore, for Law Students, this will be reported by the Law School to the licensing authorities in any jurisdiction in which you may apply to the bar.


<u>attendance</u>
 Attendance is  recommended.  Be advised that you are
responsible for any material covered in the class, whether or not it was in the readings or
lecture notes. You are also responsible for any announcements made in class. For most
students, attendance is simply essential to learning the material. If you do need to miss a
class, be sure to consult with a fellow student to learn what transpired.<br><br> 

<u>incompletes:</u> Generally speaking, the material in this course is best learned as a single unit. I
will grant incompletes only in cases where a substantial change in life circumstances occurs that
is beyond the control of the student, and only with appropriate
documentation.<br><br> 

<u>study groups.</u> You are encouraged to form a regular study group. Many students over the years
have found the study groups to be very helpful. Study groups are permitted and encouraged to
work on the problem sets together. However, each individual student should write up his or her
own answer to hand in, based on his or her own understanding of the material. Do not hand in a
copy of another person’s problem set, even a member of your own group. Writing up your own
answer helps you to internalize the group discussions and is a crucial step in the learning process.<br><br>

<!-- say who you worked with or say worked alone ! -->

<u>Academic Integrity.</u> I am very serious about this. Make no
mistake--I may appear accommodating and  informal--but I am extremely
strict about academic integrity.   Violations of academic integrity include cheating on tests or handing in
assignments that do not reflect your own work and/or the work of a study group in which you
actively participated. Handing in your own work that was performed not
for this class (e.g. other class, any other project) is cheating,
too. I have a policy of zero tolerance for cheating. Violations will be referred
to the appropriate university authorities. <br><br>
For more information see <a href="http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy/">http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy</a><br><br>

<u>Accommodating Students with Disabilities.</u>

Any student with a disability affecting performance in the class
should contact the disability office ASAP: <a href="http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html">http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html</a>
