To complete a research paper, scientists need to know the current
state of knowledge in the field. This is accomplished through a review
of the scholarly literature. Keep in mind, scholarly literature is
generally peer-reviewed to ensure that it is not merely opinions. The
literature review is critical to determine potential
&ldquo;gaps&rdquo; in the literature that your study will address
AND/OR to place your study in a theoretical base.<br /><br />

Ideally, find a literature review already published and build off
that! Do note time of publication: usually literature evolves fast and
requires frequent updates. 

<br>
<br />
Literature review is one of the most fun parts in doing research--you
will read scholarly literature about the topic of your interest! And
by doing so, you'll become an expert in the field. 
Literature review is usually the first step in research process--you
need to first find out what we know so far, so that you can conduct
informed research. These days literature review is very easy--just use
Google Scholar:&nbsp; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">https://scholar.google.com/</a><br />

<br />
A really good overview of doing literature review for  is in a video
below (note: rather for masters (say MPA) students or really fundamentals for PhDs).<br />

DO note: it is critical to synthesize/critique, *not* just summarize!

Also, it should end by showing where is the gap, or need for more and
how your own research would fit.<br />
<br />
And plan ahead: doing literature review takes time. <!-- Assignment 2 due soon asks you to perform a literature -->
<!-- review. -->
<h3>Google Scholar</h3>
Doing a literature review no longer requires a trip to the library, or
even any online library!<br />
Just use Google Scholar: quick, couple minute, decent overview is
shown in a video below.<br />

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>There are couple of things that we should pay attention to. First
  obvious question is how do i tell good article from bad? Google
  scholar will typically return thousands of hits and you need to be
  able to narrow down. First thing to do would be to adjust the
  query--these first hits will be those that match the query, so&nbsp;it really matters a great deal what your query is! So -
       think about it, and try many different ones. &nbsp;Sometimes
  have to put the phrase in quotes;&nbsp;otherwise it matches each word separately.<br />
<br />
Also do note number of citations: publications that are cited more are
  in general better, but factor in the fact that older articles will
  have more cites.<br />
<br />
Especially for the best articles click &quot;Cited by&quot; to see who
  cites that article--if there is a very good article and one that you
  are really interested in, those that cite it, are probably worth looking at too. In general, you may want to have&nbsp;a look at publications that are either very close to what you are doing or are very important--typically widely cited
  (say hundreds of citations) or very good publication outlet,
  typically a good peer reviewed journal or a book from a good
  press.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For many, or indeed most publications, do not read the whole
  thing--just skim through the abstract; sometimes skim through results and maybe conclusion--only read the very best and
  most relevant publications, do not waste time on irrelevant ones, it
  is easy to get yourself overwhelmed. This is super important! One of
  the key pieces of advice here.&nbsp;<br />
<br />


<br /><br />
Organize right away!: annotated bibliography, mark up pdfs, do free
writing--just dump it all right away! (organize and polish later) :)
<br /><br />

<!-- If you are an amateur, (not PhD student; or non-quant PhD
  student) --> May want to skip too complex
  math/stats or too complex language (especially if very advanced
  and/or not in your area (usually this is the case for masters (eg
  MPA) students)).<br />
<br />
Note that it is easy to add the article to the references list of your
  paper--from the list of results in Google Scholar for each found item there are quotation marks that you can click to pop up reference in APA and other formats, and then just copy-paste to Word document<br />
<br />
A final&nbsp;note: recent literature review papers are really useful
  and time saving! Then you can just read one paper and have the
  literature review done as opposed to going through hundreds of
  publications yourself.</p>
&nbsp;

<br />
A final note on conducting lit rev: it is difficult!

Perhaps contrary to an initial impression, doing a literature review
is difficult! People almost always end up in copy-paste mode where
they briefly summarize each research piece in a paragraph--this is 
				wrong! again you need to 
				synthesize/critique, add your own 
				value added! So you may want to go 
				through the above material more than 
				once to have it sinked in and also 
				look at the examples in 
				academic/professional literature. A 
				quick good&nbsp; from RAND Center 
				for Policing report:<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Concerns about recruiting minorities and women that dominated
police recruitment discussions decades ago have now expanded to
concerns that the profession is failing to market itself to a new
generation of workers (COPS, 2009b). Personnel costs comprise 75 to 85
percent of police department budgets, underscoring the importance of
hiring, recruiting, and selecting the best candidates, even in
uncertain times (Orrick, 2008a; White and Escobar, 2008). Agencies
have little guidance for recruitment strategies, so difficulties
persist. Jordan et al. (2009) found that only one in five agencies had
targeted recruitment strategies for women and minorities. White and
Escobar (2008, p. 120) lament police agencies&rsquo; unwillingness to
&ldquo;sell themselves&rdquo; when recruiting for diversity. As the
diversity and breadth of the communities that agencies serve expands,
agencies might face difficulties in recruiting officers for positions
that are increasingly complex, require new competencies, or require
interaction with communities whose needs they do not always know or
understand (Wilson et al. 65).&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Note it&#39;s a narrative with value added more than the citations or
summaries of them, it&#39;s a new narrative that
synthesizes/integrates what we already know in a new way.

<h3>Doing literature only: publishing literature review paper</h3>

It has to be comprehensive! Often more difficult than empirical
paper. A great exercise and a way to become an expert in the field: By
doing such comprehensive literature review, you become an expert in
the filed.

<h3>[*][mostly for phds] Taking advantage of advanced computational ways of doing a literature review</h3>

At least use goog sch recommendations!<br>

It is typically actually impossible to be really uptodate with the
literature: there is just too much! For elaboration see <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-012-0937-9">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-012-0937-9</a> and

<h3>published research should motivate analysis/modeling!</h3>

Find studies using this very same data or studies using similar data that study what you study or something similar--then follow them, also in model building, eg motivate with them use of the independent variables--modeling should be motivated by the literature and you must be able to find at least something similar


<h3>Linking dataset to literature and finding the right variables:
  Can I study X with Y dataset?</h3>


probably fastest way to go about finding variables you need:
just google what you are interested in and dataset name, eg:
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22biking%22+panel+study+of+income+dynamics&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwie0ZeXztndAhUOZd8KHUWYCiUQ5t4CMAB6BAgJEAo&biw=1314&bih=1367">https://www.google.com/search?q=%22biking%22+panel+study+of+income+dynamics&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwie0ZeXztndAhUOZd8KHUWYCiUQ5t4CMAB6BAgJEAo&biw=1314&bih=1367</a>

<h3>journals quality (and on publishing in journals)</h3>

A quick very useful guide
is <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php">https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php</a>. As
a beginning scholar, almost always you should not go for top journals,
neither you should go for "indecent journals", ie usually those
without Impact Factor (IF) (those not listed in SJR), or those with
very low IF, say less than .5. A decent starting journal has an impact
factor of about 1. Note, this differs widely by the field. Also look
at SJR indicator, actually I typically find it more telling than
IF. Also, look at trends, you want to submit to journals that are
improving.<br><br> 

Publishing takes time: many months, or typically years, and usually
articles get rejected, for decent journals more than half of the time,
and for the good ones about ninety percent of the time. But you get
reviews (unless your paper is really bad or doesn't fit): reviews are
priceless: this is the help from the field, often top scholars in the
field, also publishing is the best, and often the only, way to get
into conversation with your field. Almost always the major scholars in your niche are not at your university, but scattered around the world, and
publishing in decent, and especially good journals is the best way to
get into conversation with them. Also, fundamentally, research does
not make sense if you keep in the drawer, if you found something
interesting you should let the world know, and this is what you do by
publishing in a scholarly journal.
