note! if you have anything private like address, name, dob, ssn, etc: do not upload anywhere! First, generate some new id, like 1,2,3 and keep the full dataset secure in your own place, then deidentify: drop all sensitive info and upload this deidentified file (later if needed can merge it back to your initial file on id)<br><br>

<!-- in general for the sake of time saving please try to keep it under -->
<!-- 100mb (and definitely 1gb), if bigger just drop some variables or take -->
<!-- random sample. -->
note: if dataset is bigger than 25mb, just take a random sample, say
in stata "sample 10" to get 10perc random sample; also: zipping
reduces file about 3x (and stata can unzip, just google 'Stata
unzipfile'; of course can do the same in Python<br><br>

we may practice by putting online this file:
< ahref="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YH8DfzsQ8suZkVQBk7T9FTKvvm9Vyej8&export=download">https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YH8DfzsQ8suZkVQBk7T9FTKvvm9Vyej8&export=download</a>

<h3>google drive (upto 25mb)</h3>

 <!--  (while still -->
 <!-- logged into your Rutgers Scarletmail account) and create a simple website (only -->
 <!-- need to provide a name). Then, from the options on the top right select "create -->
 <!-- page". Give that new page a name, scroll down and click on "Add files". You can -->
 <!-- then browse to the specific file you have stored locally and upload it. Next, -->
 <!-- hover with the mouse over the download arrow to the far right-hand side of the -->
 <!-- uploaded file. Right-click there and select "Copy link address". You can now -->
 <!-- paste that link right into your do file code. Remember, there are several -->
 <!-- different code line formats that apply depending on the file type you have. If -->
 <!-- the file is in the form of an Excel spreadsheet, the line would begin with -->
 <!-- "import excel http://..."; if it is Stata format (.dta) it would be "use -->
 <!-- http://..."; if a comma-delimited file format (.csv) the code would be "import -->
 <!-- delimited http:/..." or "insheet using http://...". Don't forget to wrap the -->
 <!-- HTTP link in quotation marks. Another option is storing your files on Google -->
 <!-- Drive drive.google.com (you could use the one associated with your Rutgers -->
 <!-- Google account as well, also since it provides double the storage space than a -->
 <!-- private Google account, 30GB). -->


<dl>
<li> go to <a href="https://drive.google.com">https://drive.google.com</a>
<li> first upload the file, then right-click on it and select
 "Share...", <!-- go to "Advanced" at the bottom-right of the window and then click -->
 <!-- ``Change...'' and  check "On - Public on the Web"  and hit ``Save'' button and ``Done'' button -->
 under General access change from "Restricted" to "Anyone with the
 link", and hit "Copy link"
<li> paste link into text editor; it should look like:<br>

<!--   copy the FILE_ID from it, ie everything that follows ``id=''   -->
 and then  copy the FILE_ID from it, ie everything that is between ``/d/'' and "/view"
 <!-- <li> and then paste that FILE\_ID into -->
<!--   "https://docs.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download"  -->
<!-- <li> so it would become <a href="https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B5Y56f52-YHrMEpQX2ZwVDV0QVE&export=download">https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B5Y56f52-YHrMEpQX2ZwVDV0QVE&export=download</a> -->
<!-- <li> in this example it's a .dta file so to load it, you'd say:</br>  -->
<!--  use  "https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B5Y56f52-YHrMEpQX2ZwVDV0QVE\&export=download" -->
<li> and then paste that FILE_ID into:<br> 
  https://docs.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download

<h3>github (<25mb) EASY</h3>
 <!-- !LATER: git ignore csv  -->
<dl>
<li> can also upload files of upto 25mb (maybe even 50) to GitHub 
<li> under repo hit "Add file" and "Upload new files"
<li> then about middle-right hit "Raw"
<li> so the link is "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER/REPO/main/FILE" eg:
<li> "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blup321/vis/main/a.csv"
</dl>

		   and remember to load the 'raw' file!, eg:<be>
insheet using https://github.com/sdegiorgis/test/raw/master/PhillyParcelsSubsample.csv

<h3>github (<100mb) NOT easy</h3>

can upload data files over 25mb (but not larger than 100mb) to GitHub if you upload them
through the command in your computers command prompt (for my Mac its called terminal). It took a million articles and tutorials
but I finally got my biggest data set to upload this way! If it would be helpful, I could take the time to type up how I did 
this for my classmates/future students to use to upload bigger data sets to GitHub. One of the key articles I used is here:
https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line
