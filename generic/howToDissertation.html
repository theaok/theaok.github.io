my mission/core values:

-empower intl students and minorities
LATER can add from data science per values

ALWAYS DO collection (unless a student writes a book!) of say 3 papers for dissertation!!! not 1 blob that cant be published an unmnagable!!!
<!-- and check with danley and lori and grad office if ok for RU-camden but -->
<!-- even if not ok officially can still do like 3 papers unofficially and -->
<!-- glue together! -->


and see

<!-- from jargo's email our exchange about shourjya where he got mad and talked nonsense, but this part is actually good -->
A dissertation is not just a long paper, but rather a substantial
professional achievement, one that marks a change from student to
scholar.

<!-- yes no kidding, otherwhise blowup like with jargo: ton of comments -->
<!-- last minute -->
Have draft to send committee at least 6mo ahead of defense, preferably
8 or 9! it will take them couple weeks to get back with you! They may
not want to read early draft, but a critical idea to send them,
because often they'd offer deep comments that will take months to implement.

The idea is that committee contribute to build up early in the process and their footprint perspective is deep in dissertation

Once submitted to committee 6-9mo ahead can and should take a month off!

<h2>howto get a job</h2>
<h2>howto interview</h2>
I guess most important to show that you are exactly what they are looking for! There is always a ton of candidates so important to show you fit perfectly! Don't undersell yourself, you have no weaknesses<br>

Show enthusiasm, relax, but also definitely be very professional/rigorous/academic
