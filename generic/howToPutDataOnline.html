 <!--  (while still -->
 <!-- logged into your Rutgers Scarletmail account) and create a simple website (only -->
 <!-- need to provide a name). Then, from the options on the top right select "create -->
 <!-- page". Give that new page a name, scroll down and click on "Add files". You can -->
 <!-- then browse to the specific file you have stored locally and upload it. Next, -->
 <!-- hover with the mouse over the download arrow to the far right-hand side of the -->
 <!-- uploaded file. Right-click there and select "Copy link address". You can now -->
 <!-- paste that link right into your do file code. Remember, there are several -->
 <!-- different code line formats that apply depending on the file type you have. If -->
 <!-- the file is in the form of an Excel spreadsheet, the line would begin with -->
 <!-- "import excel http://..."; if it is Stata format (.dta) it would be "use -->
 <!-- http://..."; if a comma-delimited file format (.csv) the code would be "import -->
 <!-- delimited http:/..." or "insheet using http://...". Don't forget to wrap the -->
 <!-- HTTP link in quotation marks. Another option is storing your files on Google -->
 <!-- Drive drive.google.com (you could use the one associated with your Rutgers -->
 <!-- Google account as well, also since it provides double the storage space than a -->
 <!-- private Google account, 30GB). -->

<li> go to <a href="https://drive.google.com">https://drive.google.com</a>





<li> first upload the file, then right-click on it and select
 "Share...", go to "Advanced" at the bottom-right of the window and then click
 ``Change...'' and  check "On - Public on the Web"  and hit ``Save'' button and ``Done'' button
<li> then right-click the file again and ``Get shareable link'',  and paste
  link  into dofile; it should look like
  \url{https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5Y56f52-YHrMEpQX2ZwVDV0QVE} and then
  copy the FILE\_ID from it, ie everything that follows ``id='' 
<li> and then paste that FILE\_ID into
  \url{https://docs.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download} 
<li> so it would become \url{https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B5Y56f52-YHrMEpQX2ZwVDV0QVE&export=download}
<li> in this example it's a .dta file so to load it, you'd say\\
\ss{use  "https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B5Y56f52-YHrMEpQX2ZwVDV0QVE\&export=download"}
