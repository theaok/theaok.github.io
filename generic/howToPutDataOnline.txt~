<h3>google drive (upto 25mb)</h3>
\begin{itemize}
\item go to \url{drive.google.com}
\item first upload the file, then right-click on it and select
 "Share...", go to "Advanced" at the bottom-right of the window and then click
 ``Change...'' and  check "On - Public on the Web"  and hit ``Save'' button and ``Done'' button
\item then right-click the file again and ``Get shareable link'',  and paste
  link  into dofile; it should look like
  \url{https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5Y56f52-YHrMEpQX2ZwVDV0QVE} and then
  copy the FILE\_ID from it, ie everything that follows ``id='' 
\item and then paste that FILE\_ID into
  \url{https://docs.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download} 
\item so it would become \url{https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B5Y56f52-YHrMEpQX2ZwVDV0QVE&export=download}
\item in this example it's a .dta file so to load it, you'd say\\
\ss{use  "https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B5Y56f52-YHrMEpQX2ZwVDV0QVE\&export=download"}
\end{itemize}
