<h4>Tip of the day: Print it out</h4>
Definitely your paper!
You see things differently on paper
Rearrange move parts around
My advisor (the best geographer in the world!) Used to cut it up with scissors and glue back on the top other sheet of paper
I'm more modern and mark it up to move around: eg i'd circle couple
paragraphs and put "1->" then where i move it i put "->1" and then 2,3
etc. Do reorganize!! Move things around
<br><br>

Also print out your key articles and mark them up.

<h4>Follow scientific writing advice</h4>

sec:"links: good research in words of others"

* Don't work continuously; let it sit for 2-3 weeks, the. When you come back you see things you haven't seen before because it's all in your head and you don't realize what's on paper and what's missing wheere


* Do talk to scholars in your field that you know about from the literature--the scholars in your narrowly defined field won't be at your school! There's a handful of them, say 5-50, they'd be scattered around the world, so do email them, they'd be happy (unless it's a top top Nobel prize laureate kind of person, she'd be too busy to talk to you), you're both passionate about the same thing; coauthor! Most scholas need coauthor and like to have a new one

* Related to previous, paper is useless if help in a drawer, share it with the world, not just to impress and boost your CV, but mostly to make it better; research is a life long pursuit, it takes years or a lifetime to really figure something  out. Any the only way to do that is to work with your field. Your field doesn't know about you unless you share. You share in 2 ways: academic conferences and publications--this is the only way to take your work to the next level when you get feedback from your field--agaiin top people in your narrowly defined field, again 5-50 in the world, won't be at your school, the probability is similar to that winning a lottery.
Comments from your narrowly defined field are priceless--again the only way to take your work to the world class scholarship level. And don't get discouraged, typically you'll get rejected, I'm getting rejected say 70perc of the time after being in the field for 20 years. But you still get the priceless comments on how to make it better!

* Related to previous: keep your pipeline full--it takes on average 3mo to get comments, can take 6mo, write another paper and submit, *keep pipeline full*, I always have at least 3, ideally at least 5 papers under review.
