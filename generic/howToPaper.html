<h2>big picture</h2>


you paper must be very similar to a handful of papers already published, if it is not, if you have not found such papers, then very likely what you are doing doesn't make sense<br><br>

do something small, doable, advance knowledge by little bit; dont try
to save the world at once



<h2>dissertation</h2>

register for dissertation hours 56-824-790 "DOCT DISSERTATION"  (not
56-824-720 "DISSERTATION DEVELOP")  after passing qualifiers (its
all same dissertation hrs no matter whether before or after proposal); and need like 15 hrs (as GA get 5yrs of funding)<br><br>



dissertation is not just a long paper, but rather professional

maybe its better to have 3 paper format, unless you are into book writing<br><br>

<h1>mechanics and workflow</h1>

<h2>dont use word, excel, spss, sas</h2>

data/stats: python, stata, r (no excel, spss, sas)<br><br>

writing: either latex in github
or <a href="overleaf.com">overleaf.com</a> or google doc (just one doc
with everything in it! and then just keep on updating it (it keeps
versioning automatically: File-Version History))<br><br>




<h2>workflow</h2>

not that impossible other way, but seems most productive (at least
for me): 3 main stages <br><br>

conceptualize, figure it out, get the idea formed, ideally do start looking
at the data and literature and get basic things figured out, make a
lot of notes: this can be done at various intervals here and there<br><br>

actual production: this one you have to have blocks of uninterrupted
time! something like tens of hours, say 30hrs over Sat and Sun, (with
some sleep between); and then more blocks like that; probably around
50-200hrs, as continuously as possible; indeed best just have like one
or two  full weeks to nail it, put it >=80hrs/wk; then take like 2
weeks off!<br><br>

finally, polishing, reorganizing, redoing some of it, focusing,
simplifying, etc, like 1st stage can be done here and there<br><br>

set it aside and read in few weeks: if  you haven't looked at it for few weeks, you read it with fresh mind and
you'll discover many things are not there and not obvious logical, because as
you wrote it it was all in your head and couldn't tell  earlier something was  missing


<h2>use appendix or supplementary online material (som) a lot</h2>

In fact most of the paper should be there

Look at top journals like Nature, Science, PNAS: most of work is in
appendix or supplementary online material (som)  it may be 20, or
even 200 pages: all the details, elaborations, and supplementary
analyses, robustness checks etc. But the actual paper is several pages
only, typically just  1-3 tables/figures. Only the most
important and critical ones that make the point and tell the story;
all the other stuff thats useful but not necessary to make the key
point/tell the story is postponed to appendix/som. We obviously have
info overload, do not overload your readers, be as concise and to the
point as possible. People dont have time to read the stuff that they
dont have to. Readers just want to learn new stuff as quickly and
efficiently as possible. Rare few who want all the details and
intricacies will find them in appendix/som.


<h2>scientific writing and style</h2>

RU help (as of fa25): cooper st writing workshops

<br><br>

Do get yourself `On Writing Well`
Book by William Zinsser!!!<br><br>


And see <a href="https://theaok.github.io/swb/final_project.pdf">https://theaok.github.io/swb/final_project.pdf</a>
maybe esp sec:"links: good research in words of others"<br><br>


avoid opinion; use evidence: either literature or data<br><br>

format tables and graphs so they look like those from journal
articles<br><br>

each table/figure must have a number and *self-explanatory title/caption* (you can understand what is going on
just from reading the caption) and it must be referred from text by number! see
 again, published research for examples 
AND make these tables tight--cut decimal points to 2 or 3, and decrease spacing and padding so that table is tight and compact



<h2>do work continuously but not for too long</h2>

warning: thinking/academic work is bad for your body!!<br>

do a test: sit on laptop for couple hrs continuously (typical to get anything done), then get up and note how weak you are! <br>

and have enough of these couple hrs blocks over time and you deteriorate greatly in
general, not just physically, mentally too--sure
easy to see why working in a mine with a hammer is bad for you, but so
is thinking/academic work!<br>

thin line: do need uninterrupted blocks of time, eg all Fri, all Sat, all Sun at 14hrs per day, BUT then do other stuff like outdoors, exercise, social connection--if you do research all the time for too long it will damage your brain<br><br>

its actually good not just for happiness, but also for productivity to
take a break; have like a week or two without looking at it at all,
and then when you come back you'll not just be more productive, but
also see things you didn't see earlier; BUT before you take a break
wrap up to have it in a decent shape; AND do make notes what are the next steps and things TODO when you come back<br><br>

Let it sit for 2-3 weeks. Or even longer, few months (after the class,
of course). When you come back you see things you haven't seen before
because its all in your head and you dont realize whats on paper and
whats missing where (your head v paper).

<h2>manage complexity: be flexible and opportunistic, simplify!</h2>


<!-- im realizing its been intensive and overwhelming, so keep in mind what -->
<!-- i said yesterday: -->
simplify, be flexible and opportunistic (do whats
easy and doable now) eg readjust your hypothesis to data, keep the big
complicated stuff for later, likewise per my comments: do *NOT* do everything i ask for: much or most of my comments should be put towards the end into "limitations and future research"<br><br>

<!-- Important! be clear about them!  -->
<!-- How ideally it should be done? -->
<!-- Doesnt have to have everything perfect, but has to know whats missing!!  and say it -->


<!-- at least in some ways essentiallya key challenge and part of the--research process is managing complexity  -->
research is a process of managing complexity--simplify, make it easy on yourself, do something that is doable, postpone big ideas for later; never try to do everything now perfectly, you'll drive yourself crazy


<h2>do talk to scholars in your field that you know about from the literature</h2>
The scholars in your narrowly defined field wont be at your school. 
Threes a handful of them, say 5-50, and they're scattered around the
world--email them, they'd be happy (unless its a top top scholar like Nobel
prize, they wont talk to you).<br>

You're both passionate about the same thing; coauthor! Most scholars
need coauthors and would like to have a new one. Ideally get a junior scholar
to team up: PhD student or assistant professor, they`re more upto
date,  more eager, and more in need to do research.<br>

Can also try a senior scholar, but one thats productive, well established
(published and cited a lot).

<!-- so a top one (but again probably not very top top Nobel prize kind of thing). -->
<!-- , they`re too busy -- you need to establish yourself first to talk to them) -->

<h3>paper is useless if held in a drawer, share it
with the world</h3>

<!-- Not just to impress and boost your CV, but mostly to make it better; -->
<!-- research is a life long pursuit, it takes years or a lifetime to -->
<!-- really figure something  out. And the only way to do that is to work -->
<!-- with your field. -->
Your field doesn't know about you, unless you
share. You share ONLY in 2 ways: academic conferences and
publications--the only way to take your work to the next level when you get feedback from your field.  Again, top people
in your narrowly defined field, about 5-50 people,
  wont be at your school. Sure there will be people in related area,
but not exactly precisely in the very narrow area that YOU are--almost always you're not doing the exact same narrow area from the exact same perspective as scholars at your institution.   <br><br>


Comments from your narrowly defined field are priceless--again the only way to take your work to the world class level. And dont get discouraged, typically you'll get rejected, Im getting rejected say 80perc of the time after being in the field for 20 years. But you still get the priceless comments on how to make it better!

<h3>keep your pipeline full</h3>
  It takes about 3mo to get comments, even 6mo, write another
  paper and submit, keep it going, dont wait for comments to move on,
  you'll be stuck for months, *KEEP PIPELINE FULL*, I always have at least 3 papers under review at any given time.



<h2>usual comments on first draft of paper</h2>

I am mostly happy with your drafts,
    but, lets not be complacent and work more and try to publish it;
    really need to push it ahead and put much more work into it to
    have a good final product.<br><br> 

<!-- Again,  need to to reply inline to -->
<!-- all comments, however small they may be (most of you were shy).  -->
<!-- 2 general comments: need to beef it up and polish! See published  -->
<!-- research for examples. Bring everything together, this should be -->
<!-- cumulative: ie, intro, lit rev, data, results, -->
<!-- conclusion/discussion.  -->

Try to be objective: this is not op-ed or opinion, try to be
    scientific and present also contradicting information or other
    points of view. Make sure your text is connected to your analysis!
It flows logically.<br><br>

Sometimes, you may actually produce a lot of
    output but end up having unfinished project: this may still be an
    A if there was a lot of work involved. Indeed, often, naturally,
    producing a good paper takes a lot of time, and it is better to
    have it unfinished than force it finish and produce something
    mediocre









<h2>tip of the day: print it out</h2>
Definitely your paper!
You see things differently on paper.
Rearrange, move parts around.
My advisor <!-- (one year, the best geographers in the world!) -->
 used to cut it
up with scissors and glue back on the top of another sheet of paper. 
I'm more modern and mark it up to move around: eg I'd circle couple
paragraphs and put `1->` then where i move it i put `->1` and then 2,3
etc. And when i type it in, i move stuff around. Do reorganize, move things around.
<br><br>

Also print out your key literature, and mark them up.


<h1>data, stats, inference, research design</h1>

<h2>if data</h2>

double check your final results like vis and tables with external data for accuracy, say
https://www.policymap.com/ (there's free version) or socialexplorer.com (free on campus or vpn)
and see if your tables/vis look the same, if not, there may be error;
it's very important to double check, the worst thing to do is to
report wrong numbers, and can happen to anyone, so really have to
double check
<br><br>

think about data quality: 
<a href="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/measure.php">measurement,</a>
<a href="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/introval.php">validity</a>
<a href="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/constval.php"> (incl construct),</a>

<!-- http://www.chsbs.cmich.edu/fattah/courses/cutheory/conceptualizationOperationalization.htm -->
<br><br>

make sure to obey replication principle, eg absolutely have
to have (and submit along with assignments!) a dofile or python script etc that will produce final results
that you have in your paper from the VERY RAW data, eg data you have
downloaded from the website; elaboration <a href="https://theaok.github.io/dm/replication.pdf">https://theaok.github.io/dm/replication.pdf</a><br><br>

and for descriptive stats can use logout <a href="https://theaok.github.io/dm/exp.do">https://theaok.github.io/dm/exp.do</a>




<h3>if svy res</h3>
make sure your var is coded right way!<br>
codebook varName, tab(100)<br>
eg often var is -9 for missing!!<br>
have to recode that!eg:<br>
replace varName=. if varName==-9<br><br>

do plenty of des stats before regressions:<br>
sum var1 var2<br>
ta var1 var2, mi<br>
scatter var1 var2<br>
hist var1<br><br>

at very least every paper needs  descriptive stats for every variable: mean, sd, min, max
<br><br>

often need to reverse var, so that higher val means 'more' or 'better' and it`s intuitive eg happiness 1(lo)-3(hi), not 1(hi)-3(lo); install user written command:<br>
findit revrs<br>
<!-- revrs varName, replace<br> -->
<!-- that would create a new var revVarName -->
<br><br>

always have to have actual survey questions asked to a respondent in
the paper!

<h4>if GSS</h4>
just get the full cumulative data set 1971-24<br>
use lookfor in stata to find vars<br>
lookfor satis<br> 
to match both 'SATISfied' and 'SATISfaction'<br><br>

use
website <a href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/">https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/</a>
 to
identify vars: click 'Search Variables'  eg: 'hope' and click say
'hopeless', see on right it says 'Related Variables' so you can
snowball and catch them all on your topic


<h2>dont forget about practical/substantive sig!</h2>


think and interpret the magnitude, eg: flextime has a large effect on
happiness-the size effect is about as large as that of household
income, or about as large as a one-step increase in self-reported
health, such as up from good to excellent health: 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-017-9525-8">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-017-9525-8</a><br><br>


also may have beta coef<br>
regress happiness male city health income age age2, beta<br>
so then interpret whether your key var of interest is large or small
in magnitude as compared to other key vars such as health and income

<h2>causality/endogeneity/self-selection</h2>

always think about and address: causality, endogeneity,
self-selection (at least discuss briefly, talk about causal
mechanism/path, why would x cause y, and not the other way round, or
some other z):
<a href="http://people.bu.edu/tsimcoe/code/Endog-PDW.pdf">http://people.bu.edu/tsimcoe/code/Endog-PDW.pdf</a>



<h1>publishing game: editors, reviewers, revise and resubmit</h1>

work smart not hard and have some strategy; some pointers below


Remember the editor makes the decision, not reviewer.<br><br>

And in general in later rounds of reviews the edits to paper are lighter and lighter<br><br>

If some comment really takes you away and makes it into a new paper, say so in response to reviewer! Thank her for comments, but say that it will be a new paper, so it cant be fully accommodated here. And then indeed in the future you may write that another new paper. I did few times. Then you have 2 papers 😃<br><br>

Again one way to deal with it is to use appendix and or online supplementary material--can put there stuff to satisfy one person but avoid dissatisfying the other. Almost nobody will read appendix or online supplementary material, so whats there doesn't upset a person, but it can be used to satisfy another person--can say in response to reviewer that you took suggestions into account and put it in appendix or online supplementary material<br><br>

And yes you will actually quite often find reviewers among themselves or with editors disagreeing.<br><br>

Couple ideas how to figure out where to go:<br><br>

How strong/mild is suggestion<br><br>

Editor is more important than reviewer<br><br>

Some reviewers are more important than others (some are students some are very senior scholars), and so reviews are not equal, some are weighted more than others<br><br>

In general try to satisfy as much as possible, disagreeing risks rejection<br><br>

Sometimes do disagree, especially if a person doesn't make sense, but always be super polite and respectful<br><br>

(The more senior you become, the more you may disagree; not just that you know more, but you risk less, you already have many papers published and going on)<br><br>

Think critically, which reviewer (or editor)  makes more sense and
follow that <br><br>


<h2>if you haven't publish yet</h2>

look at journal articles! for happiness: johs journal of happiness studies,
 ariq applied research in quality of life; and in general for social
indicators such as trust and freedom: sir social indicators research<br><br>

and follow their lead! your paper should look like the recent ones
from journals in the field in terms of everything!: amount of lit,
depth and breadth of analysis, style and formatting, etc<br><br>

your paper will be evaluated by ppl who published on this recently probably in this jou; and editor who likes stuff thats published recently<br><br>

(class papers: do decide explicitly on journal and say it in the paper (and give
reasoning), say as a footnote to the title) <br><br>

make it look like a paper in a targeted journal!<br><br>

always have abstract and keywords!!<br><br>

always have "conclusion and discussion" section at the end<br><br>

marketing is kinda cool like trying to sell it well; but waste of time
in a sense that it doesn't produce anything; better strategies: 
 hot topics, new cutting-edge stuff incl data, and great/novel ideas 

<br><br>

if not from the beginning at least towards the end of paper production,
spin it towards a given journal, say:

you are shooting for Public Opinion Quarterly,
go into google scholar
and advanced search (menu on top left) and search for what you write
about, say:

abortion

published in

Public Opinion Quarterly:

https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=abortion&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_occt=any&as_sauthors=&as_publication=Public+Opinion+Quarterly&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C31

and there is a bunch! do make sure to go thru them and fix up your paper and cite them abundantly--if you submit to a given journal important to make sure to be in a good conversation with line of conversation in that journal; also these are going to be the reviewers and judges of your work--authors that publish in that journal


<h3>do start with very small/incremental contribution or even replication only</h3>

eg Heliyon: <br><br>
Any paper reporting scientifically accurate and valuable research,
which adheres to accepted ethical and scientific publishing standards,
will be considered for publication. As such, the journal also
publishes manuscripts reporting negative/null results, incremental
advances, and replication studies<br><br>
(and RU has a deal with Elsevier to cover APC (article publishing
charge)) BUT do make sure eg by contacting the journal (for Heliyon it
doesn't work)



<h3>title and abstract are important</h3>


want both title and abstract to reflect paper main points as good as possible. Title and abstract are very important! Some people will only read that and many will read the paper or not solely based on title and abstract, so in a way these are actually some of the most important parts of the paper. The key is your findings and main points you make, not background info or literature. 


<h2>journal choice and rankings</h2>

see rankings: <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php">scimagojr.com</a><br><br>
read editorials! eg see mine in SIR<br><br>
per fit, see which journal you cite a lot esp recent studies, or as per critical paper(s)
for your study (and these will be your reviewers)<br><br>
co-author with someone who published recently in a given journal!!!<br><br>
(qualitative is just rich quantitative data)<br><br>





journal: johs, sir, ariq; or the other field you study, eg drugs,
spirituality, housing, etc: papers are typically a connection of two
fields: you main IV (eg urbanism) and DV (SWB), so can ship them to
either fields journal<br><br>

publish or perish: this is dead serious, if you dont you have failed,
you'll perish 


<h1>present</h1>



do fit within time window, sharp, you will be cut off<br><br>


focus on YOUR study and YOUR contribution; not background info<br><br>

not too many slides like 1 per minute, 15 min presentation like 15 slides<br><br>

not too many lines per slide like <=12<br><br>

do take notes (right away)!!! that's the whole purpose of presenting is to get
		      comments! (to enlighten audience is typically
		      secondary) if you don't take notes, you will
		      forget the comments
<h1>AI</h1>

focus on creativity, critical thinking; automate what can be automated
