<h4>if you haven't publish yet</h4>

look at journal articles! for happiness: journal of happiness studies,
applied research in quality of life; and in general for social
indicators such as trust and freedom: social indicators research<br><br>

and follow their lead! your paper should look like the recent ones
from journals in the field in terms of everything!: amount of lit,
depth and breadth of analysis, style and formatting, etc

<h4>if data</h4>

make sure to obey replication principle, eg absolutely have
to have (and submit along with assignments!) a dofile or python script etc that will produce final results
that you have in your paper from the VERY RAW data, eg data you have
downloaded from the website; elaboration <a href="https://theaok.github.io/dm/replication.pdf">https://theaok.github.io/dm/replication.pdf</a><br><br>

per regressions follow excellent <a href="https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/webbooks/reg/">https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/webbooks/reg/</a>

and for descriptive stats can use logout <a href="https://theaok.github.io/dm/exp.do">https://theaok.github.io/dm/exp.do</a>

<h4>if svy res</h4>
make sure your var is coded right way!<br>
codebook varName, tab(100)<br>
eg often var is -9 for missing!!<br>
have to recode that!eg:<br>
replace varName=. if varName==-9<br><br>

do plenty of des stats before regressions:<br>
sum var1 var2<br>
ta var1 var2, mi<br>
scatter var1 var2<br>
hist var1<br><br>

at very least every paper needs  descriptive stats for every variable: mean, sd, min, max
<br><br>

often need to reverse var, so that higher val means 'more' or 'better' and it`s intuitive eg happiness 1(lo)-3(hi), not 1(hi)-3(lo); install user written command:<br>
findit revrs<br>
revrs varName, replace<br><br>

always have to have actual survey questions asked to a respondent in
the paper!!

<h4>if GSS</h4>
just get the full cumulative data set 1971-21<br>
use lookfor in stata to find vars<br>
lookfor satis<br> 
to match both 'SATISfied' and 'SATISfaction'<br><br>

use
website <a href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/">https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/</a>"to
identify vars: click 'Search Variables'  eg: 'hope' and click say
'hpeless', see on right it says 'Related Variables' so you can
snowball and catch them all on your topic


<h4>dont forget about practical/substantive sig!</h4>


think and interpret the magnitude, eg: flextime has a large effect on
happiness-the size effect is about as large as that of household
income, or about as large as a one-step increase in self-reported
health, such as up from good to excellent health: 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-017-9525-8">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-017-9525-8</a>


also may have beta coef<br>
regress happiness male city health income age age2, beta<br>
so then intrepret whether your key var of interest is large or small
in magnitude as compared to other key vars such as health and income



<h4>tip of the day: print it out</h4>
Definitely your paper!
You see things differently on paper.
Rearrange, move parts around.
My advisor (one year, the best geographers in the world!) used to cut it
up with scissors and glue back on the top of another sheet of paper. 
I'm more modern and mark it up to move around: eg i'd circle couple
paragraphs and put `1->` then where i move it i put `->1` and then 2,3
etc. And when i type it in, i move stuff around. Do reorganize, move things around.
<br><br>

Also print out your key literature, and mark them up.

<h4>use appendix or supplementary online material (som) a lot</h4>
Look at top journals such as Nature, Science, PNAS: most of work is in
appendix or supplementary online material (som)  it may be 20, or
even 200 pages: all the details, elaborations, and supplementary
analyses, robustness checks etc. But the actual paper is several pages
only, typically just  2-3, maybe 4-5 tables/figures. Only the most
important and critical ones that make the point and tell the story;
all the other stuff that`s useful but not necessary to make the key
point/tell the story is postponed to appendix/som. We obviously have
info overload, do not overload your readers, be as concise and to the
point as possible. People don`t have time to read the stuff that they
don`t have to. Readers just want to learn new stuff as quickly and
efficiently as possible. Rare few who want all the details and
intrincacies will find them in appendix/som.


<h4>follow scientific writing advice</h4>

Do get yourself `On Writing Well`
Book by William Zinsser!!!<br><br>


And see <a href="https://theaok.github.io/swb/final_project.pdf">https://theaok.github.io/swb/final_project.pdf</a>
sec:"links: good research in words of others"

<h4>don`t work continuously</h4>

its actually good not just for happiness, but also for productivity to take a break; have like a week or two without looking at it at all, and then when you come back youll not just be more productive, but also will see much better things you didnt see earlier; BUT before you take a break try to wrap up as much as you can so you dont lose the momentum and dont spend time on coming back to it; AND do make notes what are the next steps and things todo when you come back<br><br>


Let it sit for 2-3 weeks. Or even longer, few months (after the class,
of course). When you come back you see things you haven`t seen before
because its all in your head and you don`t realize whats on paper and
whats missing where (your head v paper).

<h4>be flexible and opportunistic</h4>


im realizing its been intensive and overwhelming, so keep in mind what
i said yesterday: simplify, be flexible and opportunistic (do whats
easy and doable now) eg readjust your hypothesis to data, keep the big complicated stuff for later,
likewise per my comments: do *NOT* do everything i ask for: much or most of my comments should be put towards the end into "limitations" and "future research"


<h4>do talk to scholars in your field that you know about from the literature</h4>
The scholars in your narrowly defined field won`t be at your school!
There`s a handful of them, say 5-50, they`re  scattered around the
world, so do email them, they`d be happy (unless it`s a top top Nobel
prize laureate kind of person, she`d be too busy to talk to you) --
you`re both passionate about the same thing; coauthor! Most scholars
need coauthor and like to have a new one. Ideally get a junior scholar
to team up: PhD student or assistant professor, they`re more upto
date, 
on the bleeding edge, more eager, and more in need to do research; if
a senior scholar, ideally one thats productive, well established
(published and cited a lot), so a top one (but again probably not very
top top Nobel prize kind of thing).<!-- , they`re too busy -- you need to establish yourself first to talk to them) -->

<h4>related to previous, paper is useless if held in a drawer, share it
with the world</h4>

Not just to impress and boost your CV, but mostly to make it better;
research is a life long pursuit, it takes years or a lifetime to
really figure something  out. And the only way to do that is to work
with your field. Your field doesn`t know about you, unless you
share. You share ONLY in 2 ways: academic conferences and
publications -- this is the only way to take your work to the next level when you get feedback from your field -- again top people
in your narrowly defined field, again about 5-50 people in the world,
  won`t be at
your school. Sure there will be people in related area at your school,
but not exactly precisely in the very narrow area that YOU are
doing -- almost always you`re not doing the exact same narrow area from 
     the exact same perspective that scholars do at your institution.   <br><br>



Comments from your narrowly defined field are priceless--again the only way to take your work to the world class level. And don`t get discouraged, typically you`ll get rejected, I`m getting rejected say 70perc of the time after being in the field for 20 years. But you still get the priceless comments on how to make it better!

<h4>related to previous: keep your pipeline full</h4>
  It takes on average 3mo to get comments, can take 6mo, write another
  paper and submit, keep it going, don`t wait for comments to move on,
  you`ll be stuck for months, *KEEP PIPELINE FULL*, I always have at least 3,
  ideally at least 5 papers under review at any given time.


<h4>style</h4>

avoid opinion; use evidence: either literature or data<br><br>

format tables and graphs so they look like those from journal
articles; each table and graph must be numbered and have a caption and
be refered to by its number from text

<h4>usual comments on first draft of paper</h4>

I am mostly happy with your drafts,
    but, lets not be complacent and work more and try to publish it;
    really need to push it ahead and put much more work into it to
    have a good final product. 
    Again,  need to to reply inline to
    all comments, however small they may be (most of you were shy). 
    2 general comments: need to beef it up and polish! See published 
    research for examples. Bring everything together, this should be
    cumulative: ie, intro, lit rev, data, results,
    conclusion/discussion. 
    Try to be objective: this is not op-ed or opinion, try to be
    scientific and present also contradicting information or other
    points of view. Make sure your text is connected to your analysis!
    It flows logically. Sometimes, you may actually produce a lot of
    output but end up having unfinished project: this may still be an
    A if there was a lot of work involved. Indeed, often, naturally,
    producing a good paper takes a lot of time, and it is better to
    have it unfinished than force it finish and produce something
    mediocre!
