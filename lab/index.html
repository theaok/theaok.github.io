Welcome to computational social science lab!<br><br>
<!-- better than "quant/linux" or "GIS" and for now and here keep it -->
<!-- official and dont use spiffy terms like i have at the top of the  cdc.org -->

The lab is meant for scientific computing, and espcially general
student/faculty collaboration in computational research, so called
Computational Social Science (CSS) or Social Data Science
(<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5915/721">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5915/721</a>).
It is also meant for workshops and small classes (eight terminals
including one for instructor). 
As of 2018, these are some of the fastest, latest and greatest
computers (short of parallel computing) using 2K monitors for
productive scientific computing. <br><br> 

The philosophy behind the lab is to encourage the best practices for
scientific computing
 (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745</a>),
which in general means producing reproducible research by writing
computer code and avoiding pointing-and-clicking.
<br><br>

Notably, the lab is open-source: it uses free community-developed
software
(<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org">https://www.linuxfoundation.org</a>,

<h3>location/access</h3>
We're in the back on the first floor of 321 Cooper St. You'll need the
key--ask any of the team members for help accessing the lab.

<h3>team</h3>
The lab is a community effort of the following team:
<dl>
<li>  faculty lead: adam okulicz-kozaryn
  adam.okulicz.kozaryn@gmail.com
<li>  student volunteers: Saul Morales sm1640@scarletmail.rutgers.edu,
  Straso Jovanovski sj372@scarletmail.rutgers.edu     
</dl>

<h3>software</h3>
<dl> "data science" software
<li> python/pycharm-community
<li> stata
<li> R/RStudio TODO
<li> GeoDa TODO
<li> qgis
<li> meld
<li> GIT (run in terminal)
</dl>

<dl> utilities
<li> terminal
<li> firefox
<li> libreoffice
<li> xournal (pdf viewer/editor)
</dl>

<h3>using the lab</h3>
Either right click on the desktop to access main software or press F12
and type name of program to run. To toggle between windows press
Alt-Tab: there is no bottom or upper menu bar like in windows or in
mac to point-and-click on programs. Likewise, there is no
point-and-click windows manager. To operate on files (move, copy,
etc): just use bash in terminal:
<a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/basic.html">http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/basic.html</a>.
To mimic two monitors, there are two desktops: desktop 1 (default) is
accessed by pressing F1, and desktop 2 is accessed by pressing F2; you
can also toggle between them using mouse scroll on desktop.<br><br>The
main computer (father) is connected to the TV or you can connect your
laptop via HDMI using extra HDMI cable, there is also remote to use
the TV. 

<h3>printing</h3>
Printer is located to the left of the lab, next to restroom. Just go
to http://172.24.35.17/print/index.php and upload your pdf
(libreoffice can save as pdf), you'll need a password, email
adam.okulicz.kozaryn@gmail.com for password. Please save the trees and
do 2-sided print :)

<h3>remote access and file transfer TODO</h3>
You access it remotely via ssh from RU network, email adam for
passwd:<br>
ssh userName@father.us.to <br>
Likewise you can transfer your files remotely via scp:
<a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/2/how-securely-transfer-files-between-servers-scp">https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/2/how-securely-transfer-files-between-servers-scp</a>. If
you're using mac or windows, just use scp client, if you don't have
one just google "scp windows client" or "scp mac client". Or just use
google drive, dropbox.com or a similar service. To connect your flash
drive/portable hard drive, ask team member for assistance.
