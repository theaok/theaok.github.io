Welcome to <!-- computational social --> data science lab!!<br><br>
<!-- better than "quant/linux" or "GIS" and for now and here keep it -->
<!-- official and dont use spiffy terms like i have at the top of the  cdc.org -->

The lab is meant for scientific computing (computational science), and especially <!-- general -->
<!-- student/faculty --> collaboration in data science<!-- computational research --><!-- , so called -->
<!-- Computational Social Science (CSS) or Social Data Science -->
 (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5915/721">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5915/721</a>).
It is also meant for workshops and small classes (eight terminals
plus one for instructor).<br>

As of 2020, these are some of the fastest, latest and greatest
computers (short of parallel computing) with 2K monitors for
productive scientific computing ( <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745</a>),
which in general means producing reproducible research by writing
computer code and avoiding pointing-and-clicking.<br>
<br><br>

Notably, the lab is open-source: it uses free community-developed
software
(<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org">https://www.linuxfoundation.org</a>,
<a href="https://www.fsf.org">https://www.fsf.org</a>). 


<h3>location/access</h3>
We're in the back on the first floor of 321 Cooper St. You'll need the
key--ask any of the team members for help accessing the lab.<br>

<h3>team</h3>
The lab is a community effort of the following team:
<dl>
<li>  lab director / faculty lead: Adam Okulicz-Kozaryn
  adam.okulicz.kozaryn@gmail.com
<li>  student volunteers: <!-- Saul Morales sm1640@scarletmail.rutgers.edu, -->
  <ul>
    <li> Straso Jovanovski sj372@scarletmail.rutgers.edu     
    <li> Shourjya Deb shourjyadb@gmail.com 
  </ul>
</dl>

<a name="howto"><h3>howto use it? (interface)</h3></a>
Left-click on the "start" button at bottom-left or right-click anywhere on desktop and pick the program (note! can just hit on keyboard first underlined letter to run the program) 
<!-- (or go to help about -->
<!-- this lab) -->. 
 Or just hit F12 <!--  (or  "Run" under bottom-left monitor icon --> and type name of
program to run: available software is listed below. 
To toggle between windows press Alt-Tab<!-- , or click on the icon in bottom panel -->.<!-- , which also has file manager on -->
<!-- the left (filecabinet icon). --><!-- : there is no bottom or upper menu bar like in windows or in -->
<!-- mac to point-and-click on programs. Likewise, there is no -->
<!-- point-and-click windows manager. To operate on files (move, copy, -->
<!-- etc): just use bash in terminal: -->
<!-- <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/basic.html">http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/basic.html</a>. -->
To mimic two monitors, there are two desktops. Desktop 1 (default): hit F1, and desktop 2: hit F2.<!-- ; you -->
<!-- can also switch between them <\!-- also toggle between them using mouse -- -->
<!-- 			  -- scroll on desktop, or -\-> by clicking  -->
<!-- desktop icons at the bottom panel on the left. --><br><br>

The main computer (named "father") with terminal at the head of the table is connected to the TV. You can also connect your laptop to TV using extra HDMI cable. And there is a remote to turn the TV on. <br>

<h4>teaching in the lab</h4>

All displays can be shown and controlled on the main display (at the head of the table): run as root /home/lab/displays.sh and don't forget to kill it after instruction with /home/lab/displaysKill.sh

<!-- Note: arrows and del don't work, but they all work on numeric pad (on -->
<!-- the right) -->

<h3>software</h3>

<dl> <b>generic</b>
  <li> <u>r</u>un (same as F12)

<h3>monitors</h3>

Note that the 4 terminals in the back have wide monitors and are best
suited for data science: can have easily code and interpreter side by side (say dofile editor and stata). And don't forget about two virtual screens using F1 and F2. 

<h3>saving/disks</h3>

Write temporary work in /tmp/, it may be deleted after your session;
write permanent work into /mnt/commons.
Best create there a directory under your name so others know it's you;
It will stay, and will be backed up and is accessible for everyone for
easy collaboration, hence 'commons'. However, everyone has write access
there and it is based on common courtesy that no one alters your
work; if you'd like private space where only you can write, email our
team member and we will give you a user name and password and assign
private space on hard drive.

<h3>printing</h3>
Printer is located to the left of the lab, next to the restroom. You can print from oofice, pdf-viewer or data scinece software.
<!-- Just go -->
<!-- to http://172.24.35.17/print/index.php and upload your pdf -->
<!-- (libreoffice can save as pdf), you'll need a password, email -->
<!-- team member for a password. --> <!-- Please save the trees and -->
<!-- do 2-sided print :)OB -->

<h3>remote access and file transfer</h3>
You can access the lab remotely via ssh from RU network, email team member
for user name and passwd and go to:<br>
userName@father.us.to <br>
Likewise, you can transfer your files remotely via scp:
<a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/2/how-securely-transfer-files-between-servers-scp">https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/2/how-securely-transfer-files-between-servers-scp</a>. If
you're using mac or windows, just use scp client, if you don't have
one just google "scp windows client" or "scp mac client". Or just use
google drive, dropbox.com or a similar service. To connect your flash
drive/portable hard drive, ask team member for assistance. 

<a name="jupyter"><h3>jupyter</h3></a>
You can run Python, R, or Stata in Jupyter. 
Browse to
to <a href="http://father.us.to:9999">http://father.us.to:9999</a>.<br>
<!-- THIS DOESNT WORK :( -->
<!-- , first connect -->
<!-- to campus via VPN with your -->
<!-- netid: <a href="https://ssl-vpn.rutgers.edu/">https://ssl-vpn.rutgers.edu/</a>, -->
<!-- then in VPN page -->
[If off-campus, install VPN and connect VPN first: <a href="https://wiki.td.rutgers.edu/wiki/Category:VPN">https://wiki.td.rutgers.edu/wiki/Category:VPN</a>]<br>
Then enter Jupyter password provided, then in top-right click 'new' and
start say Stata (unless I have already started a notebook for you), then type in your code, say<br>
<code>sysuse auto</code><br>
<code>scatter mpg price</code><br>
<code>reg mpg price</code><br>
and hit Run button at the top :)<br><br>
Note that you can also upload files from the initial Jupter screen
(just make sure you hit upload button).

<a name="rstudio"><h3>rstudio</h3></a>
rstudio is at
<a href="http://father.us.to:8787/">http://father.us.to:8787/</a>.<br>
