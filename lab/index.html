Welcome to computational social science lab!<br><br>
<!-- better than "quant/linux" or "GIS" and for now and here keep it -->
<!-- official and dont use spiffy terms like i have at the top of the  cdc.org -->

The lab is meant for scientific computing, and especially <!-- general -->
student/faculty collaboration in computational research, so called
Computational Social Science (CSS) or Social Data Science
(<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5915/721">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5915/721</a>).
It is also meant for workshops and small classes (eight terminals
plus one for instructor).<br>

As of 2018, these are some of the fastest, latest and greatest
computers (short of parallel computing) with 2K monitors for
productive scientific computing ( <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745</a>),
which in general means producing reproducible research by writing
computer code and avoiding pointing-and-clicking.<br>
<!-- <br><br> -->

Notably, the lab is open-source: it uses free community-developed
software
(<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org">https://www.linuxfoundation.org</a>,
<a href="https://www.fsf.org">https://www.fsf.org</a>). 


<h3>location/access</h3>
We're in the back on the first floor of 321 Cooper St. You'll need the
key--ask any of the team members for help accessing the lab.<br>

<h3>team</h3>
The lab is a community effort of the following team:
<dl>
<li>  faculty lead: Adam Okulicz-Kozaryn
  adam.okulicz.kozaryn@gmail.com
<li>  student volunteers: <!-- Saul Morales sm1640@scarletmail.rutgers.edu, -->
  Straso Jovanovski sj372@scarletmail.rutgers.edu     
</dl>

<a name="howto"><h3>howto use it? (interface)</h3></a>
Hit <!-- F12 (or --> "Run" under bottom-left monitor icon<!-- ) --> and type name of
program to run: available software is listed below. 
To toggle between windows press Alt-Tab, or click on the icon in bottom panel.<!-- , which also has file manager on -->
<!-- the left (filecabinet icon). --><!-- : there is no bottom or upper menu bar like in windows or in -->
<!-- mac to point-and-click on programs. Likewise, there is no -->
<!-- point-and-click windows manager. To operate on files (move, copy, -->
<!-- etc): just use bash in terminal: -->
<!-- <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/basic.html">http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/basic.html</a>. -->
To mimic two monitors, there are two desktops: desktop 1 (default) is
accessed by pressing F1, and desktop 2 is accessed by pressing F2; you
can also switch between them <!-- also toggle between them using mouse --
			  -- scroll on desktop, or --> by clicking 
desktop icons at the bottom panel on the left.<br><br>

The main computer (named "father") with terminal at the head of the table is connected to the TV. You can also connect your laptop to TV using extra HDMI cable. And there is a remote to turn the TV on. <br>

<!-- Note: arrows and del don't work, but they all work on numeric pad (on -->
<!-- the right) -->

<h3>software</h3>
<dl> <b>data science</b> 
<li> emacs (run in lxterminal)
<li> git (run in lxterminal)
<li> gummi (latex)
<li> meld
<li> pycharm-community (python)
<li> qgis
<li> rstudio (R)<!-- rstudio seems super heavy like spyder -->
<li> spyder (python)
<li> stata
<!-- <li> GeoDa  meh too heavy; just use pysal -->
<li> linux tools: sed, awk, cut, etc (run in lxterminal)
<!-- <li> latex yeah but GUI are heavy and none; and best use online -->
<!--   sharelatex/overleaf anyway -->
</dl>

<dl> <b>utilities</b>
<li> firefox
<li> libreoffice
<li> lxterminal
<li> xournal (pdf viewer/editor)
</dl>


<h3>saving/disks</h3>

Write temporary work in /tmp/, it may be deleted after your session;
write permanent work into /mnt/commons.
Best create there a directory under your name so others know it's you;
It will stay, and will be backed up and is accessible for everyone for
easy collaboration, hence 'commons'. However, everyone has write access
there and it is based on common courtesy that no one alters your
work; if you'd like private space where only you can write, email our
team member and we will give you a user name and password and assign
private space on hard drive.

<h3>printing</h3>
Printer is located to the left of the lab, next to the restroom. Just go
to http://172.24.35.17/print/index.php and upload your pdf
(libreoffice can save as pdf), you'll need a password, email
team member for a password. <!-- Please save the trees and -->
<!-- do 2-sided print :)OB -->

<h3>remote access and file transfer</h3>
You can access the lab remotely via ssh from RU network, email team member
for user name and passwd and go to:<br>
userName@father.us.to <br>
Likewise, you can transfer your files remotely via scp:
<a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/2/how-securely-transfer-files-between-servers-scp">https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/2/how-securely-transfer-files-between-servers-scp</a>. If
you're using mac or windows, just use scp client, if you don't have
one just google "scp windows client" or "scp mac client". Or just use
google drive, dropbox.com or a similar service. To connect your flash
drive/portable hard drive, ask team member for assistance. 

<a name="jupyter"><h3>jupyter</h3></a>
You can run Python or Stata in Jupyter. If off-campus, first connect
to campus with your
netid: <a href="https://ssl-vpn.rutgers.edu/">https://ssl-vpn.rutgers.edu/</a>,
then go
to <a href="http://father.us.to:9999">http://father.us.to:9999</a> and
enter jupter password provided, then in top-right click 'new' and
start say Stata, then type in your code, say<br>
<code>sysuse auto</code>
<code>scatter mpg price</code>
<code>reg mpg price</code>
