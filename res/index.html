<h3>mission/philosophy</h3>

Do talk to me about challenges at the beginning! I can accommodate
much of it, if you tell me early! <!-- Don't wait till the end of the course! --><br><br>

I will treat research methods/skills extremely broadly in this class: you
can do research in great variety of ways!!
Everyone is different (especially in this class)! 
Many ways to excel (eg opportunities for extra credit): some will excel
by doing math,  statistical programming, doing civic
engagement, having great research ideas, if you are
motivated you will excel one way or the other! if you fail in one
area, you can make it up in another area! <!-- [still, the more you fail in -->
<!-- one area, the more need to excel in others] -->


<!-- <h3>prerequisites</h3> -->

<!-- Some topics  are inherently -->
<!-- mathematical.  Yet, we will try to go slowly and focus on application and intuition -->
<!-- rather than math.   -->

<h3>course description</h3>

Data are everywhere: in public and private sectors, even in
academia. People and organizations need to be able to make sense of
data and understand others making sense of data.
<br><br>
This is a graduate introductory quantitative research methods
class. It will focus on understanding or consumption (less production)
of applied quantitative analysis for social
science. The goal is that you become a reasonably informed consumer of
 basic quantitative information, and also that you will be able to
generate basic quantitative  information.
<br><br>
<b>Are you more of a researcher, data person, analytical mind? Then  produce research in this class, eg use Python.</b>

<b>Or are you more of a manager or consumer of research? then do literature review and/or critique others' research</b>
<br><br>
Some research design and research process will be discussed as well.
<br><br>
We will go as slow as necessary, and try to have plenty of in class
discussion and will flip parts of some classes.

<h3>course objectives</h3>
<dl>
  <li> calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, and mode 
  <li> understand research process
  <li> understand quantitative information; eg basic concepts of research design, descriptive and inferential statistics <!-- (regression) --> 
  <li> understand graphs
  <!-- <li> engage civically using data in a final project (see civic engagement component) -->
  <li> present and critique academic research (done by others)

<h3>software</h3>

Unfortunately, none. BUT, you are encouraged to take part in labs,
where I will teach Python. We will try to schedule at least several of them
and as many as needed. It is 21st century, and to do research right,
you really need to use a computer!

<!-- You can install everything you'll need for free using -->
<!-- Anaconda <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download">https://www.anaconda.com/download/</a>. <\!-- Anaconda -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- is already at bsb134: run linux, and run in terminal: /usr/local/anaconda/bin/spyder -\-> -->

<!-- We will use Stata version 13 (Intercooled/IC or higher: SE or MP). -->
<!-- Older versions (>10) are fine). -->
<!-- Stata is in the classroom  and in the Robeson Computer Lab.<br><br> -->
<!-- You can buy your own Stata 13 IC/Intercooled perpetual license for -->

<h3>grading</h3>

<dl>
<li>problem sets 60% (6ps*10points)<!-- (+1ps for extra credit-so you -->
  <!-- may miss one ps and still get full credit; otherwise you get extra -->
  <!-- credit) --> (some of ps will be in-class presentation)
<!-- because we have a strict policy on problem set submission [no late ps accepted except documented emergency], it does not allow enough flexibility for random, external, etc events that affect all of us and are not emergencies. Hence, there will be one more problem set that is counted as extra credit, and is worth as much as one ps--it would make up for points you might have lost on other graded parts of the class. For instance, if you do not submit one problem set, this new extra credit problem set will make up for that. Effectively, what it means is that you may just forget about one problem set.  -->

<!-- <li>presentation        10%  !!TODO always have it!! at least 7min!!-->
<li>final presentation 30%
<!-- <li>midterm      20% just fa20 covid19-->   <!-- otherwhise could -->

 community partner(s) (civic engagment), then <15min; must use some concepts
 from the class (eg INUS, research design, correlation, regression); make graphs and fonts big<br><br>

Make it legible! Make it as big as necessary for people to be able to see easily; dont go too fast, again max 1slide per minute<br><br>

<b>its about your research, not others!! less about background and others, more about YOUR study; simplify and streamline! do not put too many regressions in final project by others! unless necessary</b>						      
<br><br>

Most of the final presentation must be about *your* research either what you did or plan to do, not what others did. This class is about to be finished, and now it is all about capstone--what are you going to do in capstone--this is what most of your final presentation should be about
<br><br>						      
						      
your project does not have to be fancy Python;  can be cross tabs and can get data from published research, blogs, Wikipedia, etc. But you need to do something new, creative, innovative, and be rigorous; and again: have to use some concepts from the class<br><br>

feedback/discussion etc, pls let me know! lets talk over email or

Rutgers University and the Professor grant you a license only to replay them for your own personal use during the course. Sharing them with others (including other students), reproducing, distributing, or posting any part of them elsewhere -- including but not limited to any internet site -- will be treated as a copyright violation and an offense against the honesty provisions of the Code of Student Conduct. Furthermore, for Law Students, this will be reported by the Law School to the licensing authorities in any jurisdiction in which you may apply to the bar.

<u>doing research with humans and other animals</u>
If you use data collected by someone else, you are fine. If you
collect your own data, do experiments, or in any way do anything with
human subjects or other animals, see <a href="https://orra.rutgers.edu/pickirb">https://orra.rutgers.edu/pickirb</a><br><br> 

<u>confidential data</u>
If you have, handle, or plan to use or collect any data that is in
any way confidential, eg: SSN, DOB, phone\#, address, name, etc: talk
to me first!<br><br> 

<u>attendance</u>
 Attendance is mandatory: there will be quizzes and if you miss them,
 you miss credit. <!-- entirely optional. However, --> You are
responsible for everything covered, including lecture, discussions,
 announcements etc. Attendance is usually essential to learning. If you miss a
class, consult with a fellow student to learn what transpired.<br><br> 

<u>incompletes:</u> Like late problem sets, only allowed in documented
emergencies (eg hospitalization).
<br><br> 

<u>study groups.</u> Many students over the years
have found the study groups to be very helpful. Study groups are permitted and encouraged to
work on the problem sets together. However, each individual student must write up his or her
own answer to hand in, based on his or her own understanding of the material. Do not hand in a
copy of another person's problem set, even a member of your own group. Writing up your own
answer helps you to internalize the group discussions and is a crucial
step in the learning process. Also, if worked in group, spell out
group members' names next to your name. You can work on problem sets
and on the presentation in a group of upto <b><u>3 people</u></b>. So your group
would hand in one presentation, but each group member would hand in her own
problem set that must differ from others [except  problem sets
that are drafts of final project; essp the later ones].<br><br>

<!-- say who you worked with or say worked alone ! -->

<u>academic integrity.</u> I am very serious about this. Make no
mistake--I may appear accommodating and informal--but I am extremely
strict about academic integrity.   Violations of academic integrity include cheating on tests or handing in
assignments that do not reflect your own work and/or the work of a study group in which you
actively participated. Handing in your own work that was performed not
for this class (eg other class, any other project) is cheating,
too. I have a policy of zero tolerance for cheating. Violations will be referred
to the appropriate university authorities. 
For more information see <a href="http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy/">http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy</a><br><br>

<u>accommodating students with disabilities.</u>

Any student with a disability affecting performance in the class
should contact the disability office ASAP: <a href="http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html">http://learn.camden.rutgers.edu/disability/disabilities.html</a>

<h3>civic engagement component (opportunity for extra credit!)</h3>
<!-- We meet every second week, during the weeks that we do not meet I will -->
<!-- assign material that reinforces what we have covered in the -->
<!-- class. Please use actively the listserv to discuss it-if there is not -->
<!-- much discussion, I will help by posting discussion topics/questions. -->

Start early. Start thinking about how you want to engage civically
today.<br><br>

Note: if you are from far away, say North Jersey, let me know as you
will be at some disadvantage, eg won't be able to take advantage of
labs. And let's plan how we can make sure you can succeed in this class!


<h4>typical civic engagement</h4>

Universities and social science should serve society. <!-- This idea will -->
<!-- be enforced in this class through graded civic engagement (in form of some of -->
<!-- the later ps). --> 
You are encouraged have to engage with local community. <br><br>

The idea is that you engage civically using research methods. There are several
ways to do it. Ideally, you will partner with a local organization,
obtain data from them, do some analysis, and present results to them. You may also use government data, say from census bureau, and present relevant
information to locals. A local organization can be Rutgers research
institute such as WRI, CURE, LEAP or any other organization such as
school or soup kitchen or CamConnect. Rutgers Office of civic
engagement may be able to help
 you contact them. The key idea is partnership:  you will use tools 
 from this class to produce output useful to local community. This 
is similar to taking a role of an apprentice at a local organization
or serving as a consultant.		     
<br><br>
Using
real world data poses challenges, which is a part of
exercise. Presenting your findings to stakeholders outside of a class
is also challenging. At the same time, it is fairly easy to contribute
locally by using simple tools learned in this class. For instance,
simple comparison of means between two schools in Camden can be
revealing and helpful locally.
<br><br>

An obvious way would be to use data at your workplace or at a
workplace of someone you know. However, you need to make sure that it
serves society in some way. For instance, it would be straightforward
if you work at a hospital or school or fire department; but it would
be difficult if you work at Starbucks.
<br><br>

<b>For instance</b>, to give just one example, in the past some
students worked for local schools and they obtained some data from
Camden City Board of Education, and they simply interpreted those data
and drew some conclusions. The idea is to evaluate the data more
broadly and interpret it in a helpful and creative way, ideally
connect to the literature and arrive at some conclusions that will
help with the school operation.  
<br><br>

Some specific ideas: hopeworks, salvation army, and  PBCIP.org

<!-- There will be two or three civic engagement ps and paper has a civic -->
<!-- engagement part: you will probably need -->
<!-- to spend estimated 20-40 hours total this semester on these -->
<!-- assignments outside of the class. -->

<h4>atypical civic engagement--CONTACT ME FIRST if you consider this!</h4>

Successful completion of atypical civic engagement will take estimated at
least double of the typical civic engagement time.

<br><br>

<!-- An apparently straightforward solution is to engage with -->
<!-- international academic community by producing research, but this is a -->
<!-- good idea only if you can produce an innovative research, which is -->
<!-- almost impossible at this stage. To do this successfully, you'd need -->
<!-- to be very sophisticated at academic research. It is easier to -->
<!-- contribute locally (traditional civic engagement) than internationally.<br><br> -->

You could try to engage at regional or State level-for
instance, you may evaluate some policy in NJ as compared to NY, or
produce descriptive statistics of a region that would be useful
regionally (eg my South Jersey WRI paper
<a href="http://dept.camden.rutgers.edu/rand-institute/files/changes-across-the-region.pdf">http://dept.camden.rutgers.edu/rand-institute/files/changes-across-the-region.pdf</a>
<!-- presentation <a href="http://wrand.rutgers.edu/files/Adam-Okulicz-Kozaryn-Changes-Across-the-Region.pdf">http://wrand.rutgers.edu/files/Adam-Okulicz-Kozaryn-Changes-Across-the-Region.pdf</a>).  -->
Such type of engagement typically requires substantial research
experience typically found at late stage of PhD program.

<!-- Another atypical way to engage civically is to help me -->
<!-- organize and catalog civic engagement datasets-you will be tasked -->
<!-- with finding useful datasets, and producing a detailed description of -->
<!-- them (metadata), researching those datasets and applying appropriate -->
<!-- tags. <br><br> -->

There may also be some other atypical ways-let me know your ideas.

<!-- <h4>other ideas</h4> -->

<!-- If you are an IPSD student try to do something with your domestic -->
<!-- internship that you started in Fall<br><br> -->
<!-- try to conatct camconnect and see if you can do any work for them -->
