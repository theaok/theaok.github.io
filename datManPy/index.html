</ul>

<h4>prerequisites</h4>

You need to be comfortable using a computer. Knowledge of Python (R, 
Stata, etc) and data-management/computer science is helpful but not
necessary. We will cover the basics. 

<b>note to social science/humanities students:</b>
This class is mostly coding/programming/scripting. <!-- if computers are -->
<!-- not your thing, the class is probably not for you. -->
If you do not like programming, this class is not for you. But you may not yet know
whether you like it and you may start liking it in this class: it often happened before!
<!-- You will need to set aside plenty of time for this class, definitely more than 10hrs per -->
<!-- week outside of classroom.   -->


<h4>course description and learning objectives/outcomes</h4>
<dl>
<li> data (sources, best practices, tips and tricks): this class
  is as much about Python as about data (you'll use the data you chose
  that will serve you well beyond this class!!) 
<li> hands-on/applied Python/Pandas (there will be some theory, too)
</dl>
<!-- Most of this class is writing simple Python code; if you do not like -->
<!-- programming, this class is not for you... But you may not yet know -->
<!-- whether you like it and  may start liking it in this class: it -->
<!--  happened before! -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
You will learn how to manage your data:  clean, organize, manipulate
and automate: eg: data types, text/math functions,  recoding,
documentation, merging, reshaping, loops, if/else.<br>   



<!-- You'll demonstrate mastery of the material by writing code for a -->
<!-- project/paper. -->

<h4>required textbooks and materials</h4>

No required textbooks. All required materials (code, readings) will be provided. 

<!-- <h4>recommended course materials</h4> -->

<!-- Will be provided as we go forward in weekly class materials, and -->
<!-- possibly added here.  -->


<h3>software</h3>

<!-- <h4>QGIS</h4> --> <!-- free download (best option: user friendly) -->
 Python >=3.10<!-- in classroom: 3.2 'Bonn' --> <!-- (latest: 3.11) -->
(<a href="https://www.python.org">python.org</a>). Can
      download for free for Linux, Win, Mac. We will use several libs,
 mostly Pandas.<br>   

BUT no need to download or install anything: we will run
  Python online (in webbrowser in the cloud), so called "colab" (2
  sections down). But first GitHub.
	
      <!-- <br><br> -->
      <!-- If you have old/broken/etc laptop: run qgis at school or off -->
      <!-- apps.camden.rutgers.edu, just go to that url in web browser; if -->
      <!-- it doesnt work, may need to activate first at: https://services.oit.rutgers.edu/services/manage.cgi?.State=Manage%20Services&arg= -->

      

<!-- <h4>GeoDa</h4> -->
<!-- <\!-- A great advantage of QGIS is that it communicates well with Python. We -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- will cover Python in the second part of class, but -\-> -->
<!-- <\!--  usage of Python  is not necessary for successful completion of this class. -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- Python is free  <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a> -\-> We'll -->
<!-- also use GeoDA for spatial statistics later in the course, which is also free and cross-platform <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu/">http://geodacenter.asu.edu/</a> -->
<!-- <br><br> -->

<a name="git"><h5>GitHub<!-- (very quick HOWTO on basic use of github.com) --></h5></a>
 <!-- (first -->
<!-- make a quick ex1.do with say just 'sysuse auto, clear' and 2nd line 'd') -->

We will use GitHub to store Python code (.py) in form of a
notebook (.ipynb), and we will edit (and run) the notebook in colab (next sec).

<dl>
<!-- <li> when submitting ps in git just have one file that you will be -->
<!--   updating for each ps!! [can just call it ps.do] -->
<!-- <li> if you are serious about programming, you should use a -->
<!--   version control system, say GIT -->
<!-- <li> set up a repo on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> -->
<!--   or <a href="https://bitbucket.org">bitbucket.org</a> or something else -->
<!-- <li> that way we will be more productive: i will be able to give you -->
<!--   much more comments and suggestions and offer more help writing code  -->
<!-- <li> it is also much more fun! and this is how code must be written if -->
<!--   you are serious about it; to get started just go to one of the above websites  -->
<!-- <li> let's talk outside of the class about GIT if you decide to use it! -->
</dl>

<li> <u>sign up or login</u> at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
  <!-- (can also use <a href="https://bitbucket.org">bitbucket.org</a> or something else) -->
<li> (depending on os/browser) on top left hit "New" or "Create
  Rpository" or top right under plus "+" select "New repository"
<li> pick some repository name, say "datman" 
  <!-- your right 'New repository' button: click it; or on -->
  <!-- the left  go to 'repositories', click 'new'; then pick some name for -->
  <!-- your repository -->; keep
  selected 'Public'; important!: under  "Initialize this repository
  with" check "Add a README file";  and hit at the bottom "Create repository"
<!-- <li> then click blue 'README' about in the middle and third of a page -->
<!--   from the top, can write something there, say brief description of -->
<!--   what you're gonna be doing, then hit 'Commit new file'  -->

 <!--  <li> now can simply hit button 'Upload files' and choose your dofile, -->
 <!-- say ps0.do, important: add some meaningful commit message, say: 'first try on importing and exporting data' and hit 'Commit -->
 <!-- changes' button -->
<li> then hit "Settings" towards the middle-top right;  on the left select
  "Collaborators" tab and hit "Add people" : "theaok", and hit "Add theaok to this repository"
</dl>

<dl><u>workflow: my comments, diffs, inline response <b>[lets go over this next week again]</b></u>
<li> i will run it in my Colab, edit, and upload back 
<li> diff and response to my comments: actually cleaner and better in
  colab: File-Revision history; <small><small> or clunky in GitHub:
   can click my commit message and see the so called
  diff--the difference between your version and my version:</small></small> important!
  do make sure to fix it up for next ps, you may even have inline
  response to my comments in your next ps (especially if sth complex
  or if you disagree) 
<li>  <!--you can either start another dofile from scratch on -->
  <!-- github.com or you can keep on working with this one--if so then -->
  <!-- download this latest version first, edit it, and upload it back when -->
  <!-- done-- --> dont forget about a meaningful commit message--can keep on
  uploading newer versions as many times as you like 
<li> note: when you click the file, you can then click 'History' and
  see how the file evolved over time :)
<li> file naming: ps1.ipynb, ps2.ipynb, etc, or
  ps1, ps2, etc sections in one file; or just one file and keep it updating throught with new stuff as we go! 
</dl>

<a name="colab"><h5>colab</h5></a> 

Just run Py notebook in Colab and save subsequent versions in
Github that will keep track of changes [stick with this for the ps]<!-- , and -->
<!-- for ps submission add me, theaok, to your github -->
<!-- (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62596466/how-can-i-run-notebooks-of-a-github-project-in-google-colab)<br> -->

<div id="data">
<h4>data</h4>
</div>

The class is a bit like an independent study: you will carry out some
very basic research. You do need your own data for this class ASAP: the more data and the more
complex, the better. Software will need to load the data straight up
from online. Some data  easily downloadable from online
eg <a href="https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data/stata">https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data/stata</a>.
 But many  not. Then you have to put data online yourself [just go over Git<25mb]:

<h4>grading</h4>

<b>2 keys to success: start early AND ask often many questions; (and study groups: get couple people on zoom, screenshare notebooks, etc)</b> This is a
  software class. It is different from typical soc sci classes! You will get
  stuck often and whenever stuck, email listserv, ask me, ask your
  classmates, as opposed to pulling
  your hair out! And stop by my office, too. Googling (and built-in Gemini)  solves most
  problems but for many things its better to talk to me and your
  classmates; also more social/human, if you talk to computer all the
  time, its not healthy.

<dl>
<li> 100% (5ps x 20%) problem sets  [just Py notebook], may cowrite code (<b>upto 2 people</b>) but then
the project should be <b>2</b> times better than a single-authored one <!-- TODO have 7 next year and make final -->
  <!-- project 30perc -->
<!-- <li> 35% final project  [just another computer code  wrapping previous ps] --> <!-- (code only; incl presentation (code and some output esp graphs<b>2*5%</b>)) -->  
<li> bonus/extra upto 5%  engagement, class participation
  eg answering/asking questions, helping others, listserv
  discussions
 <li>bonus/extra upto 5%  civic engagement (see bottom of the syllabus)

<h4>rules</h4>

<u>do not share or link to class videos!</u>
These videocasts and podcasts are the exclusive copyrighted property of Rutgers University and the Professor teaching the course. Rutgers University and the Professor grant you a license only to replay them for your own personal use during the course. Sharing them with others (including other students), reproducing, distributing, or posting any part of them elsewhere -- including but not limited to any internet site -- will be treated as a copyright violation and an offense against the honesty provisions of the Code of Student Conduct. Furthermore, for Law Students, this will be reported by the Law School to the licensing authorities in any jurisdiction in which you may apply to the bar.


<u>attendance</u>
 Attendance is  recommended.  Be advised that you are
responsible for any material covered in the class, whether or not it was in the readings or
lecture notes. You are also responsible for any announcements made in class. For most
students, attendance is simply essential to learning the material. If you do need to miss a
class, be sure to consult with a fellow student to learn what transpired.<br><br> 

<u>incompletes:</u> Generally speaking, the material in this course is best learned as a single unit. I
will grant incompletes only in cases where a substantial change in life circumstances occurs that
is beyond the control of the student, and only with appropriate
documentation.<br><br> 

<u>study groups.</u> You are encouraged to form a regular study group. Many students over the years
have found the study groups to be very helpful. Study groups are permitted and encouraged to
work on the problem sets together. However, each individual student should write up his or her
own answer to hand in, based on his or her own understanding of the material. Do not hand in a
copy of another person’s problem set, even a member of your own group. Writing up your own
answer helps you to internalize the group discussions and is a crucial step in the learning process.<br><br>

<!-- say who you worked with or say worked alone ! -->

<u>Academic Integrity.</u> I am very serious about this. Make no
mistake--I may appear accommodating and  informal--but I am extremely
strict about academic integrity.   Violations of academic integrity include cheating on tests or handing in
assignments that do not reflect your own work and/or the work of a study group in which you
actively participated. Handing in your own work that was performed not
for this class (e.g. other class, any other project) is cheating,
too. I have a policy of zero tolerance for cheating. Violations will be referred
to the appropriate university authorities. <br><br>
For more information see <a href="http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy/">http://fas.camden.rutgers.edu/student-experience/academic-integrity-policy</a><br><br>

<h3>civic engagement component (opportunity for extra credit!)</h3>
<!-- We meet every second week, during the weeks that we do not meet I will -->
<!-- assign material that reinforces what we have covered in the -->
<!-- class. Please use actively the listserv to discuss it-if there is not -->
<!-- much discussion, I will help by posting discussion topics/questions. -->

Start early. Start thinking about how you want to engage civically
today.

<!-- <h4>typical civic engagement</h4> -->

Universities and social science should serve society. <!-- This idea will -->
<!-- be enforced in this class through graded civic engagement (in form of some of -->
<!-- the later ps). --> 
You are encouraged have to engage with local community. <br><br>

The idea is that you engage civically using research methods. There are several
ways to do it. Ideally, you will partner with a local organization,
obtain data from them, do some analysis, and present results to them. You may also use government data, say from census bureau, and present relevant
information to locals. A local organization can be Rutgers research
institute such as WRI, CURE, LEAP or any other organization such as
school or soup kitchen or CamConnect. Rutgers Office of civic
engagement may be able to help
 you contact them. The key idea is partnership:  you will use tools 
 from this class to produce output useful to local community. This 
is similar to taking a role of an apprentice at a local organization
or serving as a consultant.		     
<br><br>
Using
real world data poses challenges, which is a part of
exercise. Presenting your findings to stakeholders outside of a class
is also challenging. At the same time, it is fairly easy to contribute
locally by using simple tools learned in this class. For instance,
simple comparison of means between two schools in Camden can be
revealing and helpful locally.
<br><br>

An obvious way would be to use data at your workplace or at a
workplace of someone you know. However, you need to make sure that it
serves society in some way. For instance, it would be straightforward
if you work at a hospital or school or fire department; but it would
be difficult if you work at Starbucks.

<!-- There will be two or three civic engagement ps and paper has a civic -->
<!-- engagement part: you will probably need -->
<!-- to spend estimated 20-40 hours total this semester on these -->
<!-- assignments outside of the class. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Not all of your paper need to engage civically! A part if fine. -->


<!-- <h4>atypical civic engagement--CONTACT ME FIRST if you consider this!</h4> -->

<!-- Successful completion of atypical civic engagement will take estimated at -->
<!-- least double of the typical civic engagement time. -->

<!-- <\!-- An apparently straightforward solution is to engage with -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- international academic community by producing research, but this is a -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- good idea only if you can produce an innovative research, which is -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- almost impossible at this stage. To do this successfully, you'd need -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- to be very sophisticated at academic research. It is easier to -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- contribute locally (traditional civic engagement) than internationally.<br><br> -\-> -->

<!-- You could try to engage at regional or State level-for -->
<!-- instance, you may evaluate some policy in NJ as compared to NY, or -->
<!-- produce descriptive statistics of a region that would be useful -->
<!-- regionally <\!-- (e.g. my South Jersey WRI paper -\-> -->

<!-- Such type of engagement typically requires substantial research -->

<!-- There may also be some other atypical ways-let me know your ideas. -->
