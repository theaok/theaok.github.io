<h3>prerequisites</h3>

You need to be comfortable using a computer, and able to write simple
code in Python or willing to learn it. Most of the class material is
simple coding in Python. There is no
prerequsite to know Python, you can learn it in the class.

<h3>course description</h3>

Introductory + applied: <!-- GIS (Geographic Information Systems). --> <!-- GIS is a broad subject. -->
<!-- This class is very applied with many  -->
<!-- tutorials and examples using modern GIS software: QGIS.  -->
produce maps, put interesting info 
<!-- visually appealing way --> on them. <!-- maps --><!-- ,  and conduct -->
<!-- basic research using geographical data in any discipline that uses -->
<!-- such data: -->
<!--  do basic research, -->
<!-- eg public pol/admin, sociology, -->
<!-- criminology, and public health/epidemiology. -->
GIS is useful in all fields that have any geographic/location info.<!-- --no matter what you study it <u>always</u> -->
<!-- takes place somewhere and place matters -->


<h3>course objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>manipulate data: import/export, subset, merge/join, dissolve, produce centroids, etc 
<li>visualize data: <!-- create professional --> make maps
<!-- <li>perform basic geographic analysis, such as correlation is space  -->
</ul>



<h3>required books</h3>

none

<h3>software</h3>

<!-- <h4>QGIS</h4> --> <!-- free download (best option: user friendly) -->
We'll use Python >=3.10<!-- in classroom: 3.2 'Bonn' --> (latest: 3.11)
(<a href="https://www.python.org">python.org</a>). Can
      download for free for Linux, Win, Mac. We will use several libs,
	mostly GeoPandas.<br>   

BUT no need to download or install any software: we will run
  Python online in webbrowser in the cloud, so called "Colab" (2
  sections down). But first lets get GitHub running.
	
      <!-- <br><br> -->
      <!-- If you have old/broken/etc laptop: run qgis at school or off -->
      <!-- apps.camden.rutgers.edu, just go to that url in web browser; if -->
      <!-- it doesnt work, may need to activate first at: https://services.oit.rutgers.edu/services/manage.cgi?.State=Manage%20Services&arg= -->

      

<!-- <h4>GeoDa</h4> -->
<!-- <\!-- A great advantage of QGIS is that it communicates well with Python. We -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- will cover Python in the second part of class, but -\-> -->
<!-- <\!--  usage of Python  is not necessary for successful completion of this class. -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- Python is free  <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a> -\-> We'll -->
<!-- also use GeoDA for spatial statistics later in the course, which is also free and cross-platform <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu/">http://geodacenter.asu.edu/</a> -->
<!-- <br><br> -->

<a name="git"><h5>GitHub<!-- (very quick HOWTO on basic use of github.com) --></h5></a>
 <!-- (first -->
<!-- make a quick ex1.do with say just 'sysuse auto, clear' and 2nd line 'd') -->

We will use GitHub to store the Python code in form of a notebook, and
we will edit (and run) the notebook in colab (next sec).

<dl>
<!-- <li> when submitting ps in git just have one file that you will be -->
<!--   updating for each ps!! [can just call it ps.do] -->
<!-- <li> if you are serious about programming, you should use a -->
<!--   version control system, say GIT -->
<!-- <li> set up a repo on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> -->
<!--   or <a href="https://bitbucket.org">bitbucket.org</a> or something else -->
<!-- <li> that way we will be more productive: i will be able to give you -->
<!--   much more comments and suggestions and offer more help writing code  -->
<!-- <li> it is also much more fun! and this is how code must be written if -->
<!--   you are serious about it; to get started just go to one of the above websites  -->
<!-- <li> let's talk outside of the class about GIT if you decide to use it! -->
</dl>

<li> <u>sign up or login</u> at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
  <!-- (can also use <a href="https://bitbucket.org">bitbucket.org</a> or something else) -->
<li> (depending on os, browser) on top left hit "New" or "Create
  Rpository" or top right under plus "+" select "New repository"
<li> pick some repository name, say "vis" 
  <!-- your right 'New repository' button: click it; or on -->
  <!-- the left  go to 'repositories', click 'new'; then pick some name for -->
  <!-- your repository -->; keep
  selected 'Public'; important!: under  "Initialize this repository
  with" check "Add a README file";  and hit at the bottom "Create repository"
<!-- <li> then click blue 'README' about in the middle and third of a page -->
<!--   from the top, can write something there, say brief description of -->
<!--   what you're gonna be doing, then hit 'Commit new file'  -->

 <!--  <li> now can simply hit button 'Upload files' and choose your dofile, -->
 <!-- say ps0.do, important: add some meaningful commit message, say: 'first try on importing and exporting data' and hit 'Commit -->
 <!-- changes' button -->
<li> then hit "Settings" towards the middle-top right;  on the left select
  "Collaborators" tab and hit "Add people" : "theaok", and hit "Add theaok to this repository"
</dl>

<dl><u>workflow: my comments, diffs, inline response <b>[lets go over this next week again]</b></u>
<li> i will run it in my Colab, edit, and upload back 
<li> diff and response to my comments: actually cleaner and better in
  colab: File-Revision history; <small><small> or clunky in GitHub:
   can click my commit message and see the so called
  diff--the difference between your version and my version:</small></small> important!
  do make sure to fix it up for next ps, you may even have inline
  response to my comments in your next ps (especially if sth complex
  or if you disagree) 
<li>  <!--you can either start another dofile from scratch on -->
  <!-- github.com or you can keep on working with this one--if so then -->
  <!-- download this latest version first, edit it, and upload it back when -->
  <!-- done-- -->dont forget about a meaningful commit message--can keep on
  uploading newer versions as many times as you like 
<li> note: when you click the file, you can then click 'History' and
  see how the file evolved over time :)
<li> a thought about file naming: ps1.ipynb, ps2.ipynb, etc, or
  ps1, ps2, etc sections in one file; or just one file and keep it updating throught with new stuff as we go!

<h4>data</h4>
</div>

The class is a bit like an independent study: you will carry out some
research (by making maps).
You need your own data for this class ASAP, the more data and the more
complex, the better. Software will need to load the data straight up
from online! Some data are easily downloadable from online
eg <a href="https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data/stata">https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data/stata</a>,
but many are not. Then you have to put data online yourself [just go
over Git<25mb]:

<h4>advice/requirements and grading</h4>

<dl>
<li> <!-- Strictly speaking an advice, rather than a requirement, but in -->
  <!-- practice really a requirement, as it is virtually impossible to -->
  <!-- succeed otherwise! --> <b>2 keys to success: start early AND ask often many questions; (and study groups: get couple people on zoom, screenshare notebooks, etc)</b> This is a
  software class. It is different non-software classes. You will get
  stuck often and whenever stuck, email listserv, ask me, ask your
  classmates, as opposed to pulling
  your hair out! And stop by my office, too. Googling (and chatGPT?)  solves most
  problems but for many things its better to talk to me and your
  classmates; also more social/human, if you talk to computer all the
  time, its not healthy.
<li>  Problem sets (ps):  You will write computer code that 
  does something that we covered in the class to your data. You may
  work in groups (<b><=4</b>), but <u>say who you worked with</u>,
  and the more people in the group, the better/longer the code must be.
<!-- <li> Final project is like final paper (doing some useful empirical -->
<!--   quantitative research), except that I only grade code, in fact you can submit -->
<!--   code only. 			        -->
<!-- <li> You're encouraged to write an empirical paper/report/etc on any topic<\!--  using one or more of the -\-> -->
<!--   <\!-- techniques covered in this course. A typical paper will be 5 to 20 -\-> -->
<!--   <\!-- double spaced pages -\->. I can give you comments and help with the -->
<!--   paper, and it is a good opportunity to produce a paper. But I will -->
<!--   grade only the code that you wrote to produce the results in your paper. -->
<!-- You will submit not only paper, but also code that produced results in -->
<!--   the paper; in fact, you can just submit the code.   -->
<!--  Ideally, the paper should be submitted to a professional journal for a publication. -->
</dl>

<!-- <h4>grading</h4> -->

<!-- <dl> -->
<!-- <li> 60% problem sets  (6ps x 10%) [just Pyhon code (notebook)] <\!-- TODO have 7 next year and make final -\-> -->
<!--   <\!-- project 30perc -\-> -->
<!-- <li> 30% final project  [just another computer code file wrapping previous ps] <\!-- (code only; incl presentation (code and some output esp graphs<b>2*5%</b>)) -\->   -->
<!-- <li> 10% course participation (class participation (answering/asking -->
<!--   questions, helping others, etc)  and listserv discussions) and civic -->
<!--   engagement  -->
<!-- </dl> -->

		

<u>grading (strict and harsh!) [incompletes only if documented emergency (eg hospitalization)]</u>


<ul>
  <li> 5x20 problem sets (incl presentation/s)   (can work in groups
    of <b><=4</b>, but then needs to be this many times better!) [just Pyhon code (notebook)]

<u>academic integrity.</u> I am very serious about this. Make no
mistake--I may appear accommodating and informal--but I am extremely
strict about academic integrity. Violations of academic integrity include cheating on tests or handing in
assignments that do not reflect your own work and/or the work of a study group in which you
actively participated. Handing in your own work that was performed not
for this class (e.g. other class, any other project) is cheating,
too. I have a policy of zero tolerance for cheating. Violations will be referred
to the appropriate university authorities.

<!-- This class is about management and analysis of geographic data. Students produce maps and interpret them--not only technical correctness is emphasized, but also use of GIS for problem solving and decision making.  -->
<!-- In this class students learn by example. Most, if not all, examples/tutorials/exercises that I provide are about public service.

<!-- The role of (geographic) data in   management/leadership is increasing. Students not only produce maps, but also interpret them, which usually informs decision making. Also,  at least one class is devoted to data sources--I want to show students that no matter what research question or management task they are dealing with, there will be almost always plenty of (geographic) data that can be used. -->
<!-- Mapping is an excellent tool to contribute to policy process. It is emphasized in this class that mapping can be used at least in several ways--e.g., description of a situation, monitoring of a progress/process, inference of a relationship.  -->

Start early. Start thinking about how you want to engage civically
today.

<h4>typical civic engagement</h4>

Universities and social science should serve society. <!-- This idea will -->
<!-- be enforced in this class through graded civic engagement (in form of some of -->
<!-- the later ps). --> 
You are encouraged have to engage with local community. <br><br>

The idea is that you engage civically using research methods. There are several
ways to do it. Ideally, you will partner with a local organization,
obtain data from them, do some analysis, and present results to them. You may also use government data, say from census bureau, and present relevant
information to locals. A local organization can be Rutgers research
institute such as WRI, CURE, LEAP or any other organization such as
school or soup kitchen or CamConnect. Rutgers Office of civic
engagement may be able to help
 you contact them. The key idea is partnership:  you will use tools 
 from this class to produce output useful to local community. This 
is similar to taking a role of an apprentice at a local organization
or serving as a consultant.		     
<br><br>
Using
real world data poses challenges, which is a part of
exercise. Presenting your findings to stakeholders outside of a class
is also challenging. At the same time, it is fairly easy to contribute
locally by using simple tools learned in this class. For instance,
simple comparison of means between two schools in Camden can be
revealing and helpful locally.
<br><br>

An obvious way would be to use data at your workplace or at a
workplace of someone you know. However, you need to make sure that it
serves society in some way. For instance, it would be straightforward
if you work at a hospital or school or fire department; but it would
be difficult if you work at Starbucks.
<br><br>

<!-- There will be two or three civic engagement ps and paper has a civic -->
<!-- engagement part: you will probably need -->
<!-- to spend estimated 20-40 hours total this semester on these -->
<!-- assignments outside of the class. -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Not all of your paper need to engage civically! A part if fine. -->


<h4>atypical civic engagement--CONTACT ME FIRST if you consider this!</h4>

Successful completion of atypical civic engagement will take estimated at
least double of the typical civic engagement time.

<br><br>

<!-- An apparently straightforward solution is to engage with -->
<!-- international academic community by producing research, but this is a -->
<!-- good idea only if you can produce an innovative research, which is -->
<!-- almost impossible at this stage. To do this successfully, you'd need -->
<!-- to be very sophisticated at academic research. It is easier to -->
<!-- contribute locally (traditional civic engagement) than internationally.<br><br> -->

You could try to engage at regional or State level-for
instance, you may evaluate some policy in NJ as compared to NY, or
produce descriptive statistics of a region that would be useful
regionally (e.g. my South Jersey WRI paper
<a href="http://dept.camden.rutgers.edu/rand-institute/files/changes-across-the-region.pdf">http://dept.camden.rutgers.edu/rand-institute/files/changes-across-the-region.pdf</a>
<!-- presentation <a href="http://wrand.rutgers.edu/files/Adam-Okulicz-Kozaryn-Changes-Across-the-Region.pdf">http://wrand.rutgers.edu/files/Adam-Okulicz-Kozaryn-Changes-Across-the-Region.pdf</a>).  -->
Such type of engagement typically requires substantial research
experience typically found at late stage of PhD program.

<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Another atypical way to engage civically is to help me -->
<!-- organize and catalog civic engagement datasets-you will be tasked -->
<!-- with finding useful datasets, and producing a detailed description of -->
<!-- them (metadata), researching those datasets and applying appropriate -->
<!-- tags. <br><br> -->

There may also be some other atypical ways-let me know your ideas.

<!-- <h4>other ideas</h4> -->

<!-- If you are an IPSD student try to do something with your domestic -->
<!-- internship that you started in Fall<br><br> -->
<!-- try to conatct camconnect and see if you can do any work for them -->
<!-- http://www.camconnect.org/ -->
